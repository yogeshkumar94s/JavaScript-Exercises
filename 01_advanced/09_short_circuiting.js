// Short-circuiting in JavaScript refers to the behavior of logical operators (&& and ||) to avoid unnecessary evaluations based on the truthiness or falsiness of the operands. It allows for more efficient and concise code by skipping unnecessary computations.

// Short-Circuiting with Logical AND (&&):
// The && operator short-circuits when the first operand is falsy. If the first operand is falsy, the overall expression is already known to be falsy, so the second operand is not evaluated.

const result = false && someFunction();
// someFunction() is not called because the first operand is false
console.log(result);
// Outputs: false

// Short-Circuiting with Logical OR (||):
// The || operator short-circuits when the first operand is truthy. If the first operand is truthy, the overall expression is already known to be truthy, so the second operand is not evaluated.

const result1 = true || someFunction();
// someFunction() is not called because the first operand is true
console.log(result1);
// Outputs: true

// Use Cases:

//1.0 Default Values:

const name = inputName || "Default";
//If inputName is truthy, name will be assigned its value; otherwise, it will be assigned the default value 'Default'.

//2.0 Guard Clauses:
function processInput(data) {
  if (!data) return; // Guard clause to handle falsy input
  // Rest of the processing logic
}
// In this example, if data is falsy, the function returns early, avoiding unnecessary processing.

//3.0 Conditional Execution:
isAdmin && grantAdminAccess();
//grantAdminAccess() is called only if isAdmin is truthy.

//4.0 Avoiding Errors:
const element = document.getElementById("nonExistentElement");
const textContent = element && element.textContent;
// If getElementById returns null (falsy), short-circuiting avoids an error when trying to access textContent.

//While short-circuiting can be beneficial for performance and concise code, it's crucial to use it carefully to ensure that the logic remains correct. Be mindful of the potential side effects of functions or expressions that are not evaluated due to short-circuiting.
