## Add two Numbers

### Solve the "Add two Numbers" promblem on LeetCode.

1. Write a function that takes two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each node contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

Create a few test cases with linked lists and log the sum as a linked list.

## Longest substring without repeating characters

### Solve the "Longest substring without repeating characters" problem on LeetCode.

1. Write a function that takes a string and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
   Log the length for a few test cases, including edge cases.

## Container with most water

### Solve the "Container with most water" problem on LeetCode.

1. Write a function that takes an array of non-negative integers where each integer represents the height of a line drawn at each point. Find two lines that together with the x-axis from a container, such that the container holds the most water.
   Log the maximum amount of water for a few test cases.

## 3Sum

### Solve the "3Sum" problem on LeetCode.

1. Write a function that takes an array of integers and finds all unique triplets in the array which give the sum of zero.
   Log the triplets for a few test cases, including edge cases.

## Group Anagrams

### Solve the "Group Anagrams" problem on LeetCode.

1. Write a function that takes an array of strings and groups anagrams together.
   Log the grouped anagrams for a few test cases.
