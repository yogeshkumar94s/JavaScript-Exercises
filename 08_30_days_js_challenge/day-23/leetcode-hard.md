# LeetCode hard

## Median of two sorted array

### Solve the "Median of two sorted array" problem on LeetCode.

1. Write a function that takes two sorted arrays of integers and returns the meduan of the two sorted arrays.
   Log the median for a few test cases, including edge cases.

## Merge k sorted lists

### Solve the "Merge k sorted lists" problem on LeetCode.

1. Write a function that takes an array of k linked lists, each linked list is sorted in ascending order, and merges all the linked lists into one sorted linked list.
   Create a few test cases with linked lists and log the merged list.

## Trapping rain water

### Solve the "Trapping rain water" problem on LeetCode.

1. Write a function that takes an array of non-negative representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, and computes how much water it can trap after raining.
   Log the amount of trapped water for a few test cases.

## N-Queens

### Solve the "N-Queens" problem on LeetCode.

1. Write a fucntion that places n queens on an n\*n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other, and returns all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

## Word Ladder

### Solve the "Word Ladder" problem on LeetCode.

1. Write a function that takes a begin word, an end word, and a dictionary of words, and finds the length of the shortest transformation sequence from the begin word to the end word, such that only one letter can be changed at a time and each transformed word must exist in the word list.
   Log the length of the shortest transformation sequence for a few test cases.
