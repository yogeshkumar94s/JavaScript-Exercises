// In JavaScript, a "binding" refers to the association of a name (an identifier) with a value. This is often achieved through the use of variables, constants, or functions. Let's explore the different types of bindings:

// Variables:

// Variables are used to store and manage data in JavaScript. You declare a variable using the let, const, or var keyword, and you can change the value stored in a variable throughout the program.

// Example:
let message = "Hello, World!";
console.log(message); // Outputs: Hello, World!

message = "Welcome to JavaScript!";
console.log(message); // Outputs: Welcome to JavaScript!

// Here, message is a variable that is first assigned the value "Hello, World!" and later reassigned the value "Welcome to JavaScript!"

// Constants:

// Constants are similar to variables, but their values cannot be reassigned after the initial assignment. They are declared using the const keyword.

// Example:
const pi = 3.14159;
console.log(pi); // Outputs: 3.14159

// This would result in an error because constants cannot be reassigned.
// pi = 3.14; // Error!

// In this example, pi is a constant with an initial value of 3.14159, and attempting to reassign it would result in an error.

// Functions:
// Functions are also a form of binding. They associate a name with a block of code that can be executed when the function is called.

// Example:
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greet("Alice"); // Outputs: Hello, Alice!
greet("Bob"); // Outputs: Hello, Bob!

// Here, greet is a function that takes a parameter name and prints a greeting. When the function is called with different arguments, it produces different outputs.

// Bindings are essential for managing data and organizing code in JavaScript. They provide a way to reference values, constants, and functions by name, making the code more readable and maintainable.
