// Recursion in programming is a technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. It's a powerful and elegant way to express certain algorithms and solve problems that exhibit repetitive structures. Let's explore the concept of recursion with a classic example: the factorial function.

// Factorial Function using Recursion:

function factorial(n) {
  // Base case: the factorial of 0 is 1
  if (n === 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    // Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}

// Example usage
let result = factorial(5);
console.log(result); // Output: 120

//--In this example:

//-The factorial function calculates the factorial of a number n.
//-The base case (if (n === 0)) specifies that the factorial of 0 is 1.
//-The recursive case (return n * factorial(n - 1)) expresses the factorial formula: n! = n * (n-1)!.

//**When factorial(5) is called: */

//-factorial(5) returns 5 * factorial(4).
//-factorial(4) returns 4 * factorial(3).
//-This process continues until factorial(0), which returns 1.
//-The results are then multiplied together to get the final result: 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

// Key Concepts:

//1.0 Base Case:
// Every recursive function should have a base case that specifies when the recursion should stop. In the factorial example, the base case is n === 0.

//2.0 Recursive Case:
// The recursive case defines how the problem is broken down into smaller, similar subproblems. In the factorial example, it's expressed as n * factorial(n - 1).

//3.0 Stack Frames:
// Each recursive call creates a new stack frame, which contains its own set of local variables and parameters. These stack frames are added to the call stack.

//4.0 Memory Consideration:
// Recursion can lead to a large number of function calls, potentially causing a stack overflow. Tail recursion and memoization are techniques used to address this in some cases.

// Recursion is a powerful tool, but it's important to use it judiciously to avoid stack overflow errors and unnecessary performance overhead. It is commonly used in problems with a natural recursive structure, like tree traversal, and can lead to elegant and concise solutions.
