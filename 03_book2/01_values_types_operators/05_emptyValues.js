// null:
// The null value represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is a special value assigned to a variable when there is no meaningful value or object assigned.

let myVariable = null;

console.log(myVariable); // null

// In this example, myVariable is explicitly set to null, indicating that there is no specific value or object assigned to it.

// undefined:

// The undefined value is the default value assigned to a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value.

let myVariable1;

console.log(myVariable1); // undefined

// Here, myVariable is declared but not assigned a value, so its default value is undefined.

// It's important to note that while null is a value that can be assigned, undefined is often the default state of a variable until a value is assigned. Also, when you access an object property or array element that does not exist, the result will be undefined.

let myObject = {};
console.log(myObject.nonExistentProperty); // undefined

let myArray = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(myArray[5]); // undefined

// Understanding the difference between null and undefined is essential when working with variables and objects in JavaScript. They both indicate the absence of a meaningful value, but null is often used when you want to explicitly represent the absence of an object, while undefined is more commonly associated with variables that have not been assigned a value.
