// In JavaScript, a callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of a particular task. Callbacks are a fundamental concept in asynchronous programming, allowing you to work with tasks that might take some time to complete, such as I/O operations, network requests, or animations.

// Here's a basic example of using a callback:

// Function that takes a callback
function fetchData(callback) {
  // Simulating an asynchronous operation (e.g., fetching data from a server)
  setTimeout(function () {
    const data = "This is the fetched data";
    // Execute the callback with the data as an argument
    callback(data);
  }, 1000);
}

// Callback function to handle the result
function handleData(result) {
  console.log(result);
}

// Using the function with a callback
fetchData(handleData);

// In this example:

// The fetchData function takes a callback function (handleData) as an argument.
// It simulates an asynchronous operation using setTimeout to wait for 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
// Once the operation is complete, the callback function is called with the result (data in this case).

// Callbacks are commonly used in scenarios like handling user input, making HTTP requests, or reading files. While callbacks are powerful, they can lead to a pattern known as "callback hell" or "pyramid of doom" when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations.

// Here's a simple example of "callback hell":

function fetchData(callback) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    const data = "Data from the first operation";
    callback(data);
  }, 1000);
}

function processFirstData(firstData, callback) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    const processedData = `Processed: ${firstData}`;
    callback(processedData);
  }, 1000);
}

function displayResult(finalResult) {
  console.log(finalResult);
}

// Callback hell: nested callbacks
fetchData(function (firstData) {
  processFirstData(firstData, function (processedData) {
    displayResult(processedData);
  });
});

// To address the callback hell issue, Promises and async/await were introduced to provide cleaner and more readable ways of handling asynchronous code. Nevertheless, understanding callbacks is fundamental to comprehending more advanced asynchronous patterns in JavaScript.
