Scroll events in JavaScript are triggered when the user scrolls a webpage. These events can be useful for implementing features that respond to the user's scrolling behavior, such as lazy loading of content, sticky navigation, or animations.

There are two main types of scroll events:

scroll: Triggered continuously as the user scrolls. This event is suitable for actions that need to be performed during the scrolling process.

wheel: Triggered when the user rotates the mouse wheel or uses a touchpad gesture. This event provides information about the wheel movement, allowing you to respond to the scrolling intensity.

  <div id="scrollMessage">Scrolling...</div>

  <script>
    const scrollMessage = document.getElementById('scrollMessage');

    // Scroll event
    window.addEventListener('scroll', function() {
      // Update the message on each scroll event
      scrollMessage.textContent = 'Scrolling...';
    });

    // Wheel event
    window.addEventListener('wheel', function(event) {
      // Update the message with information about the wheel movement
      scrollMessage.textContent = `Wheel movement: ${event.deltaY > 0 ? 'down' : 'up'}`;
    });
  </script>

</body>
</html>


The scroll event is used to continuously update a message indicating that the user is scrolling.

The wheel event is used to update the message with information about the direction of the wheel movement.
