### Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a **programming language** used to make web pages interactive. It is a core technology of the web, along with HTML and CSS. Here’s why it’s important:

- **Client-Side:** Runs directly in the user's browser, controlling web page behavior without needing constant communication with the server.
- **Dynamic Content:** Adds interactivity, animations, and real-time updates to websites.
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on most devices and browsers.
- **Versatile:** Can also be used on the server side (with Node.js) to build full-stack applications.

#### Key Features of JavaScript:

1. **Lightweight and Flexible**: Easy to learn and use.
2. **Event-Driven**: Reacts to user interactions like clicks and keypresses.
3. **Supports Libraries and Frameworks**: Like React, Angular, and Vue.
4. **Object-Oriented**: Uses objects to organize and manage data.

#### Example: Basic JavaScript in Action

Here’s a simple example of how JavaScript works:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>JavaScript Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 id="greeting">Hello!</h1>
    <button onclick="changeGreeting()">Click Me</button>

    <script>
      function changeGreeting() {
        document.getElementById("greeting").innerText =
          "You clicked the button!";
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

- **What It Does:** When the button is clicked, JavaScript changes the text in the `<h1>` tag.
- **Key Concepts:** The `onclick` attribute triggers the `changeGreeting` function, which modifies the page dynamically.
