// Writing doesnâ€™t use prototype

/*

The prototype is only used for reading properties.

Write/delete operations work directly with the object.

In the example below, we assign its own walk method to rabbit:

*/

let animal = {
  eats: true,
  walk() {
    /* this method won't be used by rabbit */
  },
};

let rabbit = {
  __proto__: animal,
};

rabbit.walk = function () {
  alert("Rabbit! Bounce-bounce!");
};

rabbit.walk(); // Rabbit! Bounce-bounce!

// From now on, rabbit.walk() call finds the method immediately in the object and executes it, without using the prototype:

/*


Accessor properties are an exception, as assignment is handled by a setter function. So writing to such a property is actually the same as calling a function.

For that reason admin.fullName works correctly in the code below:


let user = {
  name: "John",
  surname: "Smith",

  set fullName(value) {
    [this.name, this.surname] = value.split(" ");
  },

  get fullName() {
    return `${this.name} ${this.surname}`;
  }
};

let admin = {
  __proto__: user,
  isAdmin: true
};

alert(admin.fullName); // John Smith (*)

// setter triggers!
admin.fullName = "Alice Cooper"; // (**)

alert(admin.fullName); // Alice Cooper, state of admin modified
alert(user.fullName); // John Smith, state of user protected

Here in the line (*) the property admin.fullName has a getter in the prototype user, so it is called. And in the line (**) the property has a setter in the prototype, so it is called.
