// Error object

/*


When an error occurs, JavaScript generates an object containing the details about it. The object is then passed as an argument to catch:

try {
  // ...
} catch (err) { // <-- the "error object", could use another word instead of err
  // ...
}


For all built-in errors, the error object has two main properties:

name
Error name. For instance, for an undefined variable thatâ€™s "ReferenceError".

message
Textual message about error details.

There are other non-standard properties available in most environments. One of most widely used and supported is:

stack
Current call stack: a string with information about the sequence of nested calls that led to the error. Used for debugging purposes.


For instance:

try {
  lalala; // error, variable is not defined!
} catch (err) {
  alert(err.name); // ReferenceError
  alert(err.message); // lalala is not defined
  alert(err.stack); // ReferenceError: lalala is not defined at (...call stack)

  // Can also show an error as a whole
  // The error is converted to string as "name: message"
  alert(err); // ReferenceError: lalala is not defined
}
