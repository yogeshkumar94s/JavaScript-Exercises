### **Lexical Scoping and Closures in JavaScript**

Lexical scoping and closures are fundamental concepts in JavaScript that define how variables and functions behave in relation to the scope they are declared in. Letâ€™s break them down:

---

### **1. Lexical Scoping**

**Definition**:  
Lexical scoping means that the scope of a variable is determined by its position in the source code. In JavaScript, functions are executed in the scope where they are defined, not where they are called.

**Key Idea**:  
The scope is "lexical" because it is determined at compile time, based on where the code is written.

---

#### **Example of Lexical Scoping**

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
  const outerVariable = "I am from outer scope";

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable); // Lexically scoped
  }

  innerFunction();
}

outerFunction();
// Output: I am from outer scope
```

**Explanation**:

- The `innerFunction` has access to `outerVariable` because it is defined within the lexical scope of `outerFunction`.
- Even though `innerFunction` is executed after `outerFunction` starts, it "remembers" the scope in which it was defined.

---

### **2. Closure**

**Definition**:  
A **closure** is a function that "closes over" its lexical scope. This means that the function retains access to variables in its lexical scope, even if it is executed outside that scope.

Closures are created every time a function is defined, whether explicitly or implicitly.

---

#### **Example of a Closure**

```javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;

  return function increment() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
counter(); // Output: 1
counter(); // Output: 2
```

**Explanation**:

- The `increment` function is returned and assigned to `counter`. It is executed outside the `createCounter` function.
- However, `increment` "remembers" the `count` variable from its lexical scope, creating a closure.

---

### **Key Properties of Closures**

1. **Data Privacy**:  
   Variables in a closure are private to the function but can still be manipulated through the inner function.

2. **Persistent State**:  
   Closures allow functions to maintain state between invocations.

3. **Encapsulation**:  
   Closures help hide implementation details, exposing only what is necessary.

---

### **3. Examples to Illustrate Lexical Scoping and Closures**

#### **Example 1: Nested Functions and Lexical Scoping**

```javascript
function greeting(name) {
  const message = "Hello";

  function sayHello() {
    console.log(`${message}, ${name}!`);
  }

  sayHello();
}

greeting("Alice");
// Output: Hello, Alice!
```

**Explanation**:

- The `sayHello` function has access to both `message` and `name` because they are defined in its lexical scope.

---

#### **Example 2: Closure Retaining Scope**

```javascript
function createMultiplier(factor) {
  return function (num) {
    return num * factor;
  };
}

const double = createMultiplier(2);
console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10

const triple = createMultiplier(3);
console.log(triple(5)); // Output: 15
```

**Explanation**:

- The inner function retains access to `factor`, creating separate closures for `double` and `triple`.

---

#### **Example 3: Closures in Event Listeners**

```javascript
function setupButton(buttonId) {
  let clickCount = 0;

  document.getElementById(buttonId).addEventListener("click", function () {
    clickCount++;
    console.log(`Button clicked ${clickCount} times`);
  });
}

setupButton("myButton");
// Every click on the button will remember its own `clickCount`.
```

**Explanation**:

- The callback function "closes over" the `clickCount` variable, keeping its value between clicks.

---

#### **Example 4: Creating Private Variables**

```javascript
function createBankAccount(initialBalance) {
  let balance = initialBalance;

  return {
    deposit(amount) {
      balance += amount;
      console.log(`Deposited: ${amount}. Balance: ${balance}`);
    },
    withdraw(amount) {
      if (amount > balance) {
        console.log("Insufficient funds");
      } else {
        balance -= amount;
        console.log(`Withdrew: ${amount}. Balance: ${balance}`);
      }
    },
    getBalance() {
      console.log(`Balance: ${balance}`);
    },
  };
}

const myAccount = createBankAccount(100);
myAccount.deposit(50); // Deposited: 50. Balance: 150
myAccount.withdraw(30); // Withdrew: 30. Balance: 120
myAccount.getBalance(); // Balance: 120
```

**Explanation**:

- The `balance` variable is private and accessible only through the returned methods. This is achieved using closures.

---

#### **Example 5: Avoiding Common Closure Pitfall**

A classic example with `var` in loops:

```javascript
function createFunctions() {
  const functions = [];

  for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    functions.push(function () {
      console.log(i);
    });
  }

  return functions;
}

const funcs = createFunctions();
funcs[0](); // Output: 3
funcs[1](); // Output: 3
funcs[2](); // Output: 3
```

**Why?**

- The variable `i` is not block-scoped with `var`. The closure captures the **reference** to `i`, which changes during each iteration.

**Solution**: Use `let` to create block-scoped variables.

```javascript
function createFunctions() {
  const functions = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    functions.push(function () {
      console.log(i);
    });
  }

  return functions;
}

const funcs = createFunctions();
funcs[0](); // Output: 0
funcs[1](); // Output: 1
funcs[2](); // Output: 2
```

### **Key Differences Between Lexical Scoping and Closures**

| **Aspect**     | **Lexical Scoping**                        | **Closure**                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition** | Scope determined by where code is written. | Function retaining access to its lexical scope. |
| **Time**       | Determined at compile time.                | Created at runtime when a function is executed. |
| **Scope**      | Based on nesting of functions and blocks.  | Captures and persists variables from scope.     |
| **Usage**      | Determines accessible variables.           | Maintains state across function executions.     |

### **Best Practices with Closures**

1. **Use for Data Privacy**:  
   Protect sensitive variables from being directly accessed.

2. **Avoid Excessive Closures**:  
   Closures consume memory since they maintain references to variables.

3. **Use Block Scoping**:  
   Always prefer `let` or `const` over `var` to avoid common pitfalls.
