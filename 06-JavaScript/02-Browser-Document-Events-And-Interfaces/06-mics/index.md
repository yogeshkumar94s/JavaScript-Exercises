#### **1. Mutation Observer**

- What Is a Mutation Observer?
  - Monitoring Changes in the DOM
  - Replacing Legacy `Mutation Events`
- Setting Up a Mutation Observer:
  - Creating an Observer Instance
  - Configuring the Observer Options
  - Using `observe` and `disconnect` Methods
- Practical Use Cases:

#### **2. Selection and Range**

- **Working with Selection:**
  - Using `window.getSelection()`
  - Properties of a `Selection` Object: `anchorNode`, `focusNode`
  - Modifying Text Selections
- **Range Objects:**
  - Creating and Modifying Ranges
  - Methods: `createRange`, `setStart`, `setEnd`

- **The Event Loop Mechanism:**
  - Understanding JavaScript's Concurrency Model
  - The Role of the Call Stack and Task Queue
- **Microtasks:**
  - What Are Microtasks? (e.g., Promises, Mutation Observers)
  - How They Execute Before Macrotasks
  - Managing Order of Execution
- **Macrotasks:**
  - What Are Macrotasks? (e.g., `setTimeout`, `setInterval`)
  - Interaction Between Microtasks and Macrotasks
- Practical Example:
  - Comparing Microtask and Macrotask Execution Order
