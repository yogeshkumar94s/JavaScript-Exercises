// In JavaScript, a class is a blueprint for creating objects with a specific structure and behavior. It's a way to define a template or a model that can be used to create instances of objects sharing similar characteristics. Classes were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and provide a more structured and syntactic way to work with object-oriented programming concepts.

// Here's a basic overview of how classes work in JavaScript:

// Defining a Class:

// You can define a class using the class keyword, followed by the class name. The class can include a constructor method for initializing object properties, as well as other methods for defining its behavior.

class Car {
  constructor(make, model) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.speed = 0;
  }

  accelerate(amount) {
    this.speed += amount;
  }

  brake(amount) {
    this.speed = Math.max(0, this.speed - amount);
  }

  getSpeed() {
    return this.speed;
  }
}

// In this example, we've defined a Car class with a constructor that sets the initial make, model, and speed properties. The class also has methods (accelerate, brake, and getSpeed) that define the behavior of a car.

// Creating Instances:

// Once a class is defined, you can create instances of it using the new keyword.

const myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Camry");

// This creates a new instance of the Car class with the specified make and model.

// Keeping Interfaces Clear with Classes:

// Classes help in keeping interfaces clear by encapsulating the internal details of an object and exposing only the necessary methods and properties. The class definition serves as a clear contract or interface for interacting with objects of that class. Users of the class only need to be aware of the public methods and properties defined in the class, making it easier to understand and use.

// Using the Car class
// const myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Camry');

// myCar.accelerate(30);
// console.log(myCar.getSpeed()); // Output: 30

// myCar.brake(10);
// console.log(myCar.getSpeed()); // Output: 20

// In this example, the user of the Car class doesn't need to know about the internal implementation details, such as how speed is stored or how the brake function works. They interact with the class through the clearly defined methods (accelerate, brake, getSpeed), which provides a clean interface for using a car object.

// Inheritance:

// Classes in JavaScript also support inheritance, allowing you to create a hierarchy of classes where a child class can inherit properties and methods from a parent class. This promotes code reuse and helps in organizing the code in a more modular way.

class ElectricCar extends Car {
  constructor(make, model, batteryCapacity) {
    super(make, model); // Call the constructor of the parent class
    this.batteryCapacity = batteryCapacity;
  }

  charge() {
    console.log("Charging the electric car.");
  }
}

// In this example, ElectricCar is a child class that extends the functionality of the Car class. It has its own constructor and an additional method (charge), and it inherits the methods from the parent class.

const myElectricCar = new ElectricCar("Tesla", "Model S", "75 kWh");
myElectricCar.accelerate(50);
console.log(myElectricCar.getSpeed()); // Output: 50
myElectricCar.charge(); // Output: 'Charging the electric car.'

// Conclusion:

// Classes in JavaScript provide a way to structure code in an object-oriented manner, making it easier to organize and reuse code. They help in keeping interfaces clear by encapsulating implementation details and exposing a well-defined set of methods and properties. Classes support the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, contributing to more maintainable and modular code.

// Building readable classes is crucial for writing maintainable and understandable code. Readable classes make it easier for developers (including yourself) to comprehend the structure, purpose, and behavior of the code. Here are some guidelines for building readable classes in JavaScript:

// 1. Use Descriptive Class Names:

// Choose class names that clearly convey the purpose or role of the class. The name should be descriptive enough to give a good indication of what the class represents.

// Not so readable
class XYZ {
  // ...
}

// More readable
class Car {
  // ...
}

// 2. Follow a Consistent Naming Convention:

// Adopt a consistent naming convention for methods and properties. Whether it's camelCase, PascalCase, or another convention, consistency enhances readability.

class Book {
  getTitle() {
    // ...
  }

  getAuthor() {
    // ...
  }
}

// 3. Organize Methods Logically:

// Organize methods in a logical order within the class. Group related methods together, and consider following a convention such as placing the constructor first.

class ShoppingCart {
  constructor() {
    // ...
  }

  addItem() {
    // ...
  }

  removeItem() {
    // ...
  }

  checkout() {
    // ...
  }
}

// 4. Use Meaningful Parameter Names:

// Choose meaningful names for method parameters. This improves the readability of method invocations and clarifies the purpose of each parameter.

class Calculator {
  add(x, y) {
    // ...
  }

  multiply(factor1, factor2) {
    // ...
  }
}

// 5. Provide Clear Documentation:

// Include comments or documentation that explain the purpose of the class, its methods, and any important considerations. This is especially helpful for developers who might be working with your code in the future.

/**
 * Represents a user in the system.
 * @class
 */
class User {
  // ...
}

// 6. Keep Classes Cohesive:

// A class should have a clear, single responsibility. If a class is doing too much, consider breaking it down into smaller, more focused classes.

// Less readable (multiple responsibilities)
class UserManagementAndEmailService {
  // ...
}

// More readable (clear responsibilities)
class UserManagement {
  // ...
}

class EmailService {
  // ...
}

// 7. Avoid Excessive Method Length:

// If a method becomes too long, it can be challenging to understand at a glance. Break down lengthy methods into smaller, more manageable pieces.

class ReportGenerator {
  generateReport() {
    // Long, complex code...
  }
}

// Improved readability
class ReportGenerator {
  generateReportHeader() {
    // ...
  }

  generateReportBody() {
    // ...
  }

  generateReportFooter() {
    // ...
  }
}

// 8. Use Meaningful Defaults in Constructors:

// If a class has default values, use meaningful defaults that make sense in the context of the class.

class Circle {
  constructor(radius = 1) {
    this.radius = radius;
  }
}

// 9. Consider Readability in Property Naming:

// Choose property names that are meaningful and self-explanatory. Avoid overly abbreviated or cryptic names.

class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }
}

// 10. Encapsulate Complex Logic:

// If a class contains complex logic, consider encapsulating it in well-named methods. This makes it easier to understand the high-level behavior without diving into the details.

class DataProcessor {
  processData(data) {
    // Complex data processing logic...
  }
}

// By following these guidelines, you can create classes that are not only functional but also highly readable and maintainable. Prioritize clarity and simplicity in your class design to enhance collaboration and reduce the cognitive load for anyone working with your code.
