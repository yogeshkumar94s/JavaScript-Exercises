//Q. Explain the difference between the microtask queue and the task queue in the context of the event loop. How does the order of execution differ for microtasks and tasks?
//Q. Discuss the concurrency models in JavaScript, including the event loop, Web Workers, and Atomics. How can each be leveraged for different types of concurrency?
//Q. Explore the internals of the event loop in JavaScript. How does the event loop manage the execution of tasks and microtasks, and what role do the message queue and call stack play?
//Q. Discuss strategies for scheduling and prioritizing tasks in an asynchronous JavaScript application. How can you control the order of execution for different types of tasks?
//Q. Differentiate between concurrency and parallelism in the context of JavaScript. How do they relate to the execution of asynchronous tasks?
//Q. Explain the concept of shared memory and atomic operations in the context of concurrent programming. How can they be used to manage shared data safely?
//Q. Explore the use of async generators and iterators in JavaScript. How do they facilitate asynchronous iteration, and in what scenarios might they be useful?
//Q. Discuss techniques for canceling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. How can you implement cancellation in a way that is both effective and resource-efficient?
//Q. Examine best practices for error handling in asynchronous code. How can you ensure that errors are handled appropriately in Promise chains and async/await constructs?
//Q. Introduce the concept of reactive programming and observables in JavaScript. How can reactive patterns enhance the management of asynchronous data streams?
