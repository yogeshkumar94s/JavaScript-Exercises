//Q. Write your versions of the every and some array methods using a higher-order function. Explain how they differ from the built-in methods.
//Q. Use the reduce function to implement a recursive function, such as calculating the factorial of a number or summing elements in an array.
//Q. Write a function that mimics the behavior of flatMap for arrays. Explain how it differs from map and flat in its functionality.
//Q. Discuss the concept of memoization and how it can be applied to improve the performance of recursive functions. Provide an example demonstrating memoization.
//Q. Explain the concept of function composition. How can you compose multiple functions into a single function? Provide an example.
//Q. Define partial application in the context of higher-order functions. How might you use partial application to create more flexible functions?
//Q. Discuss currying and its relationship to function arity. Provide examples illustrating how to curry functions and when it might be beneficial.
//Q. Explore the bind method on functions in JavaScript. How does it allow you to create partially applied functions?
//Q. Compare and contrast different functional programming paradigms, such as pure functions, immutability, and avoiding side effects. How can they enhance code quality?
//Q. Implement an advanced version of the filter array method that allows filtering based on a provided function that evaluates each element.
