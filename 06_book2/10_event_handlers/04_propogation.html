Event propagation in the context of the DOM (Document Object Model) refers to the process by which an event travels through the hierarchy of DOM nodes. There are two phases of event propagation: capturing phase and bubbling phase.

1. Capturing Phase:
During the capturing phase, the browser starts from the root of the DOM tree and traverses down to the target element. The event is captured by each ancestor element in the order of the hierarchy until it reaches the target element. Event handlers specified during the capturing phase are executed at this stage.

<div id="parent">
    <button id="child">Click me</button>
  </div>
  
  <script>
    const parent = document.getElementById('parent');
  
    parent.addEventListener('click', function() {
      console.log('Capturing phase - Parent clicked!');
    }, true); // 'true' enables capturing phase
  
    const child = document.getElementById('child');
  
    child.addEventListener('click', function() {
      console.log('Bubbling phase - Child clicked!');
    });
  </script>
  

In this example, the capturing phase is enabled for the parent element. When the button is clicked, the event first goes through the capturing phase (from the root to the target).

2. Target Phase:

Once the capturing phase is complete, the event reaches the target element. Event handlers attached directly to the target element are executed at this point.

3. Bubbling Phase:

After the target phase, the event starts to bubble up from the target element back to the root of the DOM tree. Event handlers specified during the bubbling phase are executed in reverse order of the hierarchy.


<div id="parent">
    <button id="child">Click me</button>
  </div>
  
  <script>
    const parent1 = document.getElementById('parent');
  
    parent1.addEventListener('click', function() {
      console.log('Capturing phase - Parent clicked!');
    }, true); // 'true' enables capturing phase
  
    const child1 = document.getElementById('child');
  
    child1.addEventListener('click', function() {
      console.log('Bubbling phase - Child clicked!');
    });
  </script>
  

  <!-- In this example, the bubbling phase is the default behavior. When the button is clicked, the event goes through the capturing phase (from the root to the target) and then enters the bubbling phase (from the target back to the root). -->

  <!-- stopPropagation(): -->

<!-- The stopPropagation() method can be used to prevent further propagation of the event, either during the capturing or bubbling phase. For example: -->

child.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    console.log('Bubbling phase - Child clicked!');
    event.stopPropagation(); // Stops further propagation
  });
