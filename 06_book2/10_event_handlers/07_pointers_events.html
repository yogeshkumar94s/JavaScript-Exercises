Pointer events in JavaScript are designed to handle interactions with pointing devices, such as a mouse, touchpad, or touchscreen. These events provide a unified way to handle both mouse and touch input, making it easier to create applications that work across various devices. Pointer events include:

pointerdown: Triggered when a pointing device button (usually a mouse button) is pressed down.
pointerup: Triggered when a pointing device button is released.
pointermove: Triggered when the pointer is moved.
pointerover: Triggered when the pointer is moved into an element.
pointerout: Triggered when the pointer is moved out of an element.
pointercancel: Triggered when the pointer event is canceled (e.g., due to touch contact being canceled).

The HTML document contains a <div> element with the id "myElement."
CSS styles are applied to the element for better visibility.
JavaScript code adds event listeners for various pointer events on the element.
When a pointer event occurs, a corresponding message is logged to the console.
