Key events in JavaScript correspond to interactions with the keyboard. These events are triggered when a user presses, releases, or holds down a key. Common key events include:

keydown: Triggered when a key is pressed down.
keyup: Triggered when a key is released.

    const input = document.getElementById('myInput');

    input.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
      // Log information about the keydown event
      console.log('Keydown event - Key pressed:', event.key);
      console.log('Key code:', event.keyCode);
      console.log('Ctrl key:', event.ctrlKey);
      console.log('Shift key:', event.shiftKey);
      console.log('Alt key:', event.altKey);
    });

    input.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
      // Log information about the keyup event
      console.log('Keyup event - Key released:', event.key);
    });
  </script>

</body>
</html>

The HTML document contains an input element (<input type="text" id="myInput" placeholder="Type something">).

JavaScript code adds event listeners for both keydown and keyup events on the input element.

When a key is pressed (keydown), information about the key, key code, and modifier keys (Ctrl, Shift, Alt) is logged to the console.

When a key is released (keyup), information about the released key is logged to the console.

Key codes provide numeric representations of keys and are used for cross-browser compatibility. Note that the keyCode property is deprecated, and the key property is preferred for identifying the pressed key. The event.key property returns a string representing the key value.
